660,," We develop a model linking maximum damage awards available to plaintiffs in wrongful termination lawsuits, workers' propensity to sue as a function of experience, and returns to experience. Using Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data on protected-worker discrimination complaints and labor-market data from the Current Population Survey, we examine how returns to experience among protected workers changed around the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. We show that employers' reactions to employment protections may induce redistributive effects. Furthermore, these effects operate not merely across groups of differing protected status, but also within groups of identical protected status.

661,," During the 1980's, theories were developed to explain the striking correlation between real exchange rates and foreign direct investment (FDI). However, this relationship broke down for Japanese FDI in the 1990's, as the real exchange rate appreciated while FDI plummeted. We propose the relative access to credit hypothesis and show that unequal access to credit by Japanese firms contributes to the explanation of declining Japanese FDI. Using bank-level and firm-level data sets, we find that financial difficulties at banks were economically and statistically important in reducing the number of FDI projects by Japanese firms into the United States.

662,," This paper shows how competition generates reputation-building behavior in repeated interactions when the product quality observed by consumers is a noisy signal of firms' effort level. There are two types of firms and ""good"" firms try to distinguish themselves from ""bad"" firms. Although consumers get convinced that firms which are repeatedly successful in providing high quality are good firms, competition endogenously generates the outside option inducing disappointed consumers to leave firms. This threat of exit induces good firms to choose high effort, allowing good reputations to be valuable, but its uncompromising execution forces good firms out of the market.

663,," Auctions are generally not efficient when the object's expected value depends on private and common value information. We report a series of first-price auction experiments to measure the degree of inefficiency that occurs with financially motivated bidders. While some subjects fall prey to the winner's curse, they weigh their private and common value information in roughly the same manner as rational bidders, with observed efficiencies close to predicted levels. Increased competition and reduced uncertainty about the common value positively affect revenues and efficiency. The public release of information about the common value also raises efficiency, although less than predicted. (JEL C72, D44)","Goeree K.

664,," We investigate the ability of expected utility theory to account for simultaneous gambling and insurance. Contrary to a previous claim that borrowing and lending in perfect capital markets removes the demand for gambles, we show expected utility theory with nonconcave utility functions can explain gambling. When the rates of interest and time preference are equal, agents seek to gamble unless income falls in a finite set of values. When they differ, there is a range of incomes where gambles are desired. Different borrowing and lending rates can account for persistent gambling provided the rates span the rate of time preference.

665,," An income tax provides implicit insurance by dampening the variability of disposable income and consumption. Using an empirical framework derived from the consumption insurance literature and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics we examine the effect of federal income tax reforms of the 1980's on automatic stabilization of consumption. Overall, ERTA and TRA86 reduced consumption stability by about 50 percent. Recently increased EITC generosity restored or enhanced consumption insurance. The welfare cost of moving to the post-TRA86 system is sizable for relatively risk-averse households facing large income risk but is much more modest for the typical household.

666,," This paper evaluates the effects of fiscal policy on investment using a panel of OECD countries. We find a sizeable negative effect of public spending—and in particular of its wage component—on profits and on business investment. This result is consistent with different theoretical models in which government employment creates wage pressure for the private sector. Various types of taxes also have negative effects on profits, but, interestingly, the effects of government spending on investment are larger than those of taxes. Our results can explain the so-called ""non-Keynesian"" (i.e., expansionary) effects of fiscal adjustments.

The experiment includes three different implementations of the model: a decentralized implementation with multiple agents and a market for capital, a treatment where individual subjects are placed in the role of social planners, and a treatment where the social planner consists of five agents making a joint decision.

668,," We decompose labor-productivity growth into components attributable to (1) technological change (shifts in the world production frontier), (2) technological catch-up (movements toward or away from the frontier), and (3) capital accumulation (movement along the frontier). The world production frontier is constructed using deterministic methods requiring no specification of functional form for the technology nor any assumption about market structure or the absence of market imperfections. We analyze the evolution of the cross-country distribution of labor productivity in terms of the tripartite decomposition, finding that technological change is decidedly nonneutral and that both growth and bipolar international divergence are driven primarily by capital deepening.

669,," This paper presents dual estimates of total factor productivity growth (TFPG) for East Asian countries. While the dual estimates of TFPG for Korea and Hong Kong are similar to the primal estimates, they exceed the primal estimates by 1 percent a year for Taiwan and by more than 2 percent for Singapore. The reason for the large discrepancy for Singapore is because the return to capital has remained constant, despite the high rate of capital accumulation indicated by Singapore's national accounts. This discrepancy is not explained by financial market controls, capital income taxes, risk premium changes, and public investment subsidies.

787,," We analyze politically motivated privatization in a bipartisan environment. When median-class voters a priori favor redistributive policies, a strategic privatization program allocating them enough shares can induce a voting shift away from left-wing parties whose policy would reduce the value of shareholdings. To induce median-class voters to buy enough shares to shift political preferences, strategic rationing and underpricing is often necessary. In the extreme, this may lead to free share distribution and voucher privatization. Shifting voting preferences becomes impossible when strong ex ante political constraints require large upfront transfers to insiders or when social inequality is extreme.

788,," Rising educational attainment and research intensity in recent decades suggest that the U.S. economy is far from its steady state. This paper develops a model reconciling these facts with the stability of U.S. growth rates. In the model, long-run growth arises from the worldwide discovery of ideas, which depends on population growth. Nevertheless, constant growth can temporarily proceed at a faster rate, provided research intensity and educational attainment rise steadily over time. Growth accounting reveals that these factors explain 80 percent of recent U.S. growth, with less than 20 percent coming from world population growth.

789,," This paper offers new evidence on the sources of cross-country income differences. It exploits the idea that observing immigrant workers from different countries in the same labor market provides an opportunity to estimate their human-capital endowments.

New products are developed in diversified cities, trying processes borrowed from different activities.

The initially disenfranchised poor can contest power by threatening revolution, especially when the opportunity cost is low, for example, during recessions. The threat of revolution may force the elite to democratize. Democracy may not consolidate because it is redistributive, and so gives the elite an incentive to mount a coup. Highly unequal societies are less likely to consolidate democracy, and may end up oscillating between regimes and suffer substantial fiscal volatility.","Acemoglu, Daron Robinson, James A.",10.1257/aer.91.4.938,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.4.938,2001/09,A Theory of Political Transitions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.4.938,2001.0,191

Life-cycle models attribute this variation to differences in time preference rates, risk tolerance, exposure to uncertainty, relative tastes for work and leisure at advanced ages, and income replacement rates.

This paper tests whether rents fostered by regulation were shared with labor, and whether firms were discriminating by sharing these rents disproportionately with male workers. We find that average compensation and average wages for banking employees fell after states deregulated. Male wages fell by about 12 percent after deregulation, whereas women's wages fell by only 3 percent, suggesting that rents were shared mainly with men. Women's share of employment in managerial positions also increased following deregulation.","Black, Sandra E.

The model shows that a system of centralized redistribution can lead to less efficient outcomes if labor or capital are not mobile; and an inefficient outcome, with incomplete or no factor mobility, receives a majority of votes in both countries, whenever the structure of labor markets is very different in the two countries.","Perotti, Roberto",10.1257/aer.91.3.596,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.596,2001/06,Is a Uniform Social Policy Better?

865,E62 H24 H30," This paper uses a new, large-scale, dynamic life-cycle simulation model to compare the welfare and macroeconomic effects of transitions to five fundamental alternatives to the U.S. federal income tax, including a proportional consumption tax and a flat tax. The model incorporates intragenerational heterogeneity and a detailed specification of alternative tax systems. Simulation results project significant long-run increases in output for some reforms. For other reforms, namely those that seek to insulate the poor and initial older generations from adverse welfare changes, long-run output gains are modest.","Altig, David Auerbach, Alan J.

866,Q15 Z13 J43 L14," Survey data suggest that cropsharing contracts exhibit a much higher degree of uniformity than is warranted by economic fundamentals. We propose a dynamic model of contract choice to explain this phenomenon. Landowners and tenants recontract periodically, taking into account expected returns as well as conformity with local practice. The resulting stochastic dynamical system is studied using techniques from statistical mechanics. The most likely states consist of patches where contractual terms are nearly uniform, separated by boundaries where the terms shift abruptly. These and other predictions of the model are borne out by survey data on agricultural contracts in Illinois.","Young, H.

867,D82 D44 D72," We study a contest with multiple, nonidentical prizes. Participants are privately informed about a parameter (ability) affecting their costs of effort. The contestant with the highest effort wins the first prize, the contestant with the second-highest effort wins the second prize, and so on until all the prizes are allocated. The contest's designer maximizes expected effort. When cost functions are linear or concave in effort, it is optimal to allocate the entire prize sum to a single ""first"" prize. When cost functions are convex, several positive prizes may be optimal.","Moldovanu, Benny Sela, Aner",10.1257/aer.91.3.542,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.542,2001/06,The Optimal Allocation of Prizes in Contests,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.542,2001.0,216
868,M54 D23 J33 J41," Much of the existing theory of incentives describes a static relationship that lasts for just one transaction. This static assumption is not only unrealistic, but the resulting predictions appear to be at odds with many work organizations. The current paper introduces possible long-term interaction among agents, and studies how the design of explicit incentives and work organizations can exploit, and interact with, the implicit incentives generated by the repeated interaction of the agents. The optimal incentive scheme is shown to display observed features of the increasingly popular ""teams,"" such as the use of low-powered, group incentives.","Che, Yeon-Koo Yoo, Seung-Weon",10.1257/aer.91.3.525,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.525,2001/06,Optimal Incentives for Teams,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.525,2001.0,217
869,D83 D81," Suppose that agents share risks in competitive markets. We show that better information makes everyone worse off if the economy has a representative agent--that is, the economy's demand for state-contingent consumption equals the demand of a hypothetical agent who owns all the economy's wealth. The representative agent, moreover, is normatively unrepresentative: although each agent dislikes information, the ""representative"" agent is indifferent. Although we emphasize pure exchange, our results imply that a representative-agent model might seriously misstate the welfare effects of improved information in an economy with production and risk sharing, even if it performs well otherwise.","Schlee, Edward E.",10.1257/aer.91.3.509,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.509,2001/06,The Value of Information in Efficient Risk-Sharing Arrangements,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.509,2001.0,218
870,D83 C72," An evolutionary game model shows how an equilibrium distribution of competence may evolve when members of a population prey on one another, but when predatory competence is costly to acquire. Under one interpretation, the competence distribution is an endogenously determined distribution of bounded rationality. An example shows how ""tricksters"" and ""suckers"" might coexist in the long run. The analysis leads to a curious result about a mixed equilibrium for a symmetric, zero-sum game. An increase in the costs of one or more competence levels has exactly zero effect on the fraction of the population at those levels.","Conlisk, John",10.1257/aer.91.3.475,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.475,2001/06,Costly Predation and the Distribution of Competence,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.475,2001.0,219
871,D40 L10," This paper introduces a new model of exchange: networks, rather than markets, of buyers and sellers. It begins with the empirically motivated premise that a buyer and seller must have a relationship, a ""link,"" to exchange goods. Networks--buyers, sellers, and the pattern of links connecting them--are common exchange environments. This paper develops a methodology to study network structures and explains why agents may form networks. In a model that captures characteristics of a variety of industries, the paper shows that buyers and sellers, acting strategically in their own self-interests, can form the network structures that maximize overall welfare.","Kranton, Rachel E.

872,L11 L86 D83," We examine the equilibrium interaction between a market for price information (controlled by a gatekeeper) and the homogenous product market it serves. The gatekeeper charges fees to firms that advertise prices on its Internet site and to consumers who access the list of advertised prices. Gatekeeper profits are maximized in an equilibrium where (a) the product market exhibits price dispersion; (b) access fees are sufficiently low that all consumers subscribe; (c) advertising fees exceed socially optimal levels, thus inducing partial firm participation; and (d) advertised prices are below unadvertised prices. Introducing the market for information has ambiguous social welfare effects.","Baye, Michael R.

873,L82 L22," I examine the effects of vertical integration between programming and distribution in the cable television industry. I assess the effects of ownership structure on program offerings, prices, and subscriptions, and I compare consumer welfare across integrated and unintegrated markets. The results of this analysis suggest two general conclusions. First, integrated operators tend to exclude rival program services, suggesting that certain program services cannot gain access to the distribution networks of vertically integrated cable system operators. Second, vertical integration does not harm, and may actually benefit, consumers because of the associated efficiency gains.","Chipty, Tasneem",10.1257/aer.91.3.428,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.428,2001/06,"Vertical Integration, Market Foreclosure, and Consumer Welfare in the Cable Television Industry",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.428,2001.0,222
874,D44 Q23," When bidders anticipate an opportunity for resale trade, the value of winning an auction is determined in part by the option values of buying and selling in the secondary market. One implication is that a bidder's willingness to pay at an auction increases with the expected level of competition between resale buyers. Empirical evidence from auctions of timber contracts supports this prediction and rejects standard models that ignore resale. The estimated effect is smaller after policy changes expected to diminish the prevalence of resale. Additional evidence supports the predicted presence of a common value element introduced by the resale opportunity.","Haile, Philip A.",10.1257/aer.91.3.399,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.399,2001/06,Auctions with Resale Markets: An Application to U.S. Forest Service Timber Sales,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.399,2001.0,223
875,L13 L12 L41 N72," Detailed notes on weekly meetings of the sugar-refining cartel show how communication helps firms collude, and so highlight the deficiencies in the current formal theory of collusion. The Sugar Institute did not fix prices or output. Prices were increased by homogenizing business practices to make price cutting more transparent. Meetings were used to interpret and adapt the agreement, coordinate on jointly profitable actions, ensure unilateral actions were not misconstrued as cheating, and determine whether cheating had occurred. In contrast to established theories, cheating did occur, but sparked only limited retaliation, partly due to the contractual relations with selling agents.","Genesove, David Mullin, Wallace P.",10.1257/aer.91.3.379,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.379,2001/06,"Rules, Communication, and Collusion: Narrative Evidence from the Sugar Institute Case",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.379,2001.0,224

983,H43 D61," By incorporating the probability distribution directly into the analysis, this paper proposes a new theoretical approach to resolving the perennial dilemma of being uncertain about what discount rate to use in cost-benefit analysis. A numerical example is constructed from the results of a survey based on the opinions of 2,160 economists. The main finding is that even if every individual believes in a constant discount rate, the wide spread of opinion on what it should be makes the effective social discount rate decline significantly over time. Implications and ramifications of this proposed ""gamma-discounting"" approach are discussed.","Weitzman, Martin L.",10.1257/aer.91.1.260,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.260,2001/03,Gamma Discounting,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.260,2001.0,332

Our survey of U.S. universities supports this view, emphasizing the embryonic state of most technologies licensed and the need for inventor cooperation in commercialization. Thus, for most university inventions, there is a moral-hazard problem with inventor effort. For such inventions, development does not occur unless the inventor's income is tied to the licensee's output by payments such as royalties or equity. Sponsored research from the licensee cannot by itself solve this problem.","Jensen, Richard Thursby, Marie",10.1257/aer.91.1.240,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.240,2001/03,Proofs and Prototypes for Sale: The Licensing of University Inventions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.240,2001.0,333

We compare a winner-take-all system--where all the spoils go to the winner--to a proportional system--where the spoils of office are split among candidates proportionally to their share of the vote.

987,E24 J64," Behind similar unemployment rates in the United States and Portugal hide two very different labor markets. Unemployment duration is three times longer in Portugal than in the United States. Symmetrically, flows of workers into unemployment are three times lower in Portugal. These lower flows come in roughly equal proportions from lower job creation and destruction, and from lower worker flows given job creation and destruction. A plausible explanation is high employment protection in Portugal. High employment protection makes economies more sclerotic; but because it affects unemployment duration and worker flows in opposite directions, the effect on unemployment is ambiguous.","Blanchard, Olivier Portugal, Pedro",10.1257/aer.91.1.187,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.187,2001/03,What Hides Behind an Unemployment Rate: Comparing Portuguese and U.S. Labor Markets,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.187,2001.0,336

It provides a number of examples in which, contrary to what is commonly believed, active monetary policy gives rise to multiple equilibria and passive monetary policy renders the equilibrium unique.","Benhabib, Jess Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie Uribe, Martin",10.1257/aer.91.1.167,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.167,2001/03,Monetary Policy and Multiple Equilibria,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.167,2001.0,337

In addition, its business-cycle implications represent a substantial improvement over the standard model. It accounts for persistence in output, comovement of employment across different sectors over the business cycle, the evidence of ""excess sensitivity"" of consumption growth to output growth, and the ""inverted leading-indicator property of interest rates,"" that interest rates are negatively correlated with future output.","Boldrin, Michele Christiano, Lawrence J.

If a fully funded defined-contribution Social Security system tries to exploit the equity premium by selling a dollar of bonds per capita and buying a dollar of equity per capita, consumers who save but do not participate in the stock market will increase their consumption, thereby reducing saving and capital accumulation. Calibration of a general-equilibrium model indicates that this policy could reduce the aggregate capital stock substantially, by about 50 cents per capita.","Abel, Andrew B.",10.1257/aer.91.1.128,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.128,2001/03,The Effects of Investing Social Security Funds in the Stock Market When Fixed Costs Prevent Some Households from Holding Stocks,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.128,2001.0,339
991,D91 G11," According to conventional wisdom, long-term bonds are appropriate for conservative long-term investors. This paper develops a model of optimal consumption and portfolio choice for infinite-lived investors with recursive utility who face stochastic interest rates, solves the model using an approximate analytical method, and evaluates conventional wisdom. As risk aversion increases, the myopic component of risky asset demand disappears but the intertemporal hedging component does not. Conservative investors hold assets to hedge the risk that real interest rates will decline. Long-term inflation-indexed bonds are most suitable for this purpose, but nominal bonds may also be used if inflation risk is low.","Campbell, John Y.

In both environments, individuals are given some responsibility to make their own asset-allocation decisions, raising concerns about how well they do at this task. This paper investigates one aspect of the task, namely diversification. We show that some investors follow the ""1/n strategy"": they divide their contributions evenly across the funds offered in the plan. Consistent with this naive notion of diversification, we find that the proportion invested in stocks depends strongly on the proportion of stock funds in the plan.","Benartzi, Shlomo Thaler, Richard H.",10.1257/aer.91.1.79,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.79,2001/03,Naive Diversification Strategies in Defined Contribution Saving Plans,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.79,2001.0,341

These features of ""crony capitalism"" are actually more pronounced in Western Europe. In both regions, the salient agency problem is expropriation of outside shareholders by controlling shareholders. Dividends provide evidence on this. Group-affiliated corporations in Europe pay higher dividends than in Asia, dampening insider expropriation. Dividend rates are higher in Europe, but lower in Asia, when there are multiple large shareholders, suggesting that they dampen expropriation in Europe, but exacerbate it in Asia.","Faccio, Mara Lang, Larry H.

This paper tests whether there exists a feedback process of the economic regime on individual preferences. We exploit the experiment of German separation and reunification to establish exogeneity of the economic system. We find that, after German reunification, East Germans are more in favor of state intervention than West Germans. This effect is especially strong for older cohorts. We further find that East Germans' preferences converge toward those of West Germans. It will take one to two generations for preferences to converge completely.

However, some studies have argued half of the missing women can be explained by infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV).

The sex ratio at birth rises for the higher birth order and that in families where the first two children are female.

1157,D64 L31 Z13," This paper experimentally examines image motivation--the desire to be liked and well regarded by others--as a driver in prosocial behavior (doing good), and asks whether extrinsic monetary incentives (doing well) have a detrimental effect on prosocial behavior due to crowding out of image motivation.

1383,E24 J23," This comment addresses a point raised in Russell Cooper and Jonathan Willis (2003, 2004), which discusses whether the ""gap approach"" is appropriate to describe the adjustment of production factors. They show that this approach to labor adjustment as applied in Ricardo J. Caballero, Eduardo Engel, and John C. Haltiwanger (1997) and Caballero and Engel (1993) can falsely generate evidence in favor of nonconvex adjustment costs, even if costs are quadratic. Simulating a dynamic model of firm-level employment decisions with quadratic adjustment costs and estimating a gap model from the simulated data, they identify two factors producing this spurious evidence: approximating dynamic adjustment targets by static ones, and estimating the static targets themselves. This comment reassesses whether the first factor indeed leads to spurious evidence in favor of fixed adjustment costs. We show that the numerical approximation of the productivity process is pivotal for Cooper and Willis's finding. With more precise approximations of the productivity process, it becomes rare to falsely reject the quadratic adjustment cost model due to the approximation of dynamic targets by static ones.

1459,F10 R12," Thirty years have passed since a small group of theorists began applying concepts and tools
from industrial organization to the analysis of international trade. The new models of trade that
emerged from that work didn't supplant traditional trade theory so much as supplement it, creating
an integrated view that made sense of aspects of world trade that had previously posed major
puzzles. The ""new trade theory""—an unfortunate phrase, now quite often referred to as ""the old
new trade theory""—also helped build a bridge between the analysis of trade between countries
and the location of production within countries.
In this paper I will try to retrace the steps and, perhaps even more important, the state of mind
that made this intellectual transformation possible. At the end I'll also ask about the relevance
of those once-revolutionary insights in a world economy that, as I'll explain, is arguably more
classical now than it was when the revolution in trade theory began.","Krugman, Paul",10.1257/aer.99.3.561,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.99.3.561,2009/06,The Increasing Returns Revolution in Trade and Geography,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.99.3.561,2009.0,435

higher-income households sort into higher-quality schools. The key prediction,
borne out in data from Chile's liberalized education market, is that schools
at the class-size cap adjust prices (or enrollments) to avoid adding an additional
classroom, which generates discontinuities in the relationship between

reducing aggregate output and savings. Removing such distortions by eliminating
the estate tax does not necessarily imply that everyone would be better

The job-seeker's only credible threat during bargaining is to hold out for a better deal. The employer's threat is to delay bargaining. Consequently, the outcome of the bargain depends on the relative costs of delays to the parties, rather than on the payoffs that result from exiting negotiations.

They show that a stable allocation exists if contracts are substitutes for each hospital. They further claim that if a hospital's preferences violate the substitutes condition, there exist singleton preferences for the other hospitals and doctors such that no stable allocation exists. We show this last claim does not hold in general.

This work argues that diminishing impatience originates from the distinction between the certain present and the risky future. A simple functional representation of preferences, exhibiting time inconsistency when the future is uncertain, is derived. Experimental evidence, which is inconsistent with other formulations that account for diminishing impatience, supports the proposed approach.

Consider resources that are differentiated only by their pollution content. For instance, both coal and natural gas are used to generate electricity, yet coal is more polluting. We show that the ordering of extraction need not be driven by whether a resource is clean or dirty. Coal may be used first, followed by natural gas, and again by coal. Such ""vacillation"" does not occur under cost heterogeneity.

We estimate that Medicaid could explain the lack of private long-term care insurance for about two-thirds of the wealth distribution, even if no other factors limited the market's size. Yet Medicaid provides incomplete consumption smoothing for most individuals. Medicaid's crowd-out effect stems from the large implicit tax (about 60-75 percent for a median-wealth individual) that Medicaid imposes on private insurance. An implication is that public policies designed to stimulate the private insurance market will have limited efficacy as long as Medicaid's large implicit tax remains.","Brown, Jeffrey R.

analysis shows that the share of liquid assets that households invest in

The younger generation's decisions depend on beliefs about the quality of existing institutions, norms, and values, which are influenced by collective memory. In culturally homogeneous societies it can be optimal to suppress negative memories while emphasizing positive ones. However, the ability to bias collective memory is costly: it may generate cultural overoptimism and overinvestment in some cases, the reverse in other cases. The scope for welfare-enhancing manipulation of collective memory is reduced, moreover, in culturally heterogeneous societies.

Households face
housing price risk in the sense that the relative price of housing varies over time, and can invest in a wide variety of financial assets in addition to housing.

However, we demonstrate that higher female inequality in the marriage market
reduces polygyny. Moreover, we show that female inequality increases in the

demographic shifts affect profits and returns across industries. Cohort size fluctuations
produce forecastable demand changes for age-sensitive sectors, such as
toys, bicycles, beer, life insurance, and nursing homes. These demand changes are
predictable once a specific cohort is born. We use lagged consumption and demographic
data to forecast future consumption demand growth induced by changes
in age structure. We find that demand forecasts predict profitability by industry.
Moreover, forecast demand changes five to ten years in the future predict annual
industry stock returns. One additional percentage point of annualized demand
growth due to demographics predicts a 5 to 10 percentage point increase in annual
abnormal industry stock returns. However, forecasted demand changes over shorter
horizons do not predict stock returns. A trading strategy exploiting demographic

of their pivotal decision makers. This bias is measured by a decision maker’s risk/
reward ratio from a war compared to that of the country at large. If there is no
political bias, then there are mutually acceptable transfers from one country to
the other that will avoid a war in the presence of commitment or enforceability of
peace treaties. There are cases with a strong enough bias on the part of one or both
countries where war cannot be prevented by any transfer payments. Our results
shed some new light on the uneven contender paradox and the interpretation of the

show that when transfers are possible, at least one country will choose a biased
leader, as that leads to a strong bargaining position and extraction of transfers.

We find that the performance of markets in China and Western Europe overall was

Yet a major source of growth, R&D, is procyclical. This paper argues one reason
for procyclical R&D is a dynamic externality inherent in R&D that makes entrepreneurs
short-sighted and concentrate their innovation in booms, even when it is
optimal to concentrate it in recessions. Additional forces may imply that procyclical
R&D is desirable, but equilibrium R&D is likely to be too procyclical, and macroeconomic

prospect theoryincluding the prediction of distaste for insuring losseswhen
exposure to risk is a surprise, but implies first-order risk aversion when a risk,

We find a sizeable negative effect of public spending—and in particular of its wage component—on profits and on business investment. This result is consistent with different theoretical models in which government employment creates wage pressure for the private sector. Various types of taxes also have negative effects on profits, but, interestingly, the effects of government spending on investment are larger than those of taxes. Our results can explain the so-called ""non-Keynesian"" (i.e., expansionary) effects of fiscal adjustments.

2035,," This paper describes the design and behavior of an experimental economy with the structure of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model of optimal growth. The experiment includes three different implementations of the model: a decentralized implementation with multiple agents and a market for capital, a treatment where individual subjects are placed in the role of social planners, and a treatment where the social planner consists of five agents making a joint decision. The findings highlight the role of market institutions in facilitating convergence to the optimal steady state.

2036,," We decompose labor-productivity growth into components attributable to (1) technological change (shifts in the world production frontier), (2) technological catch-up (movements toward or away from the frontier), and (3) capital accumulation (movement along the frontier). The world production frontier is constructed using deterministic methods requiring no specification of functional form for the technology nor any assumption about market structure or the absence of market imperfections. We analyze the evolution of the cross-country distribution of labor productivity in terms of the tripartite decomposition, finding that technological change is decidedly nonneutral and that both growth and bipolar international divergence are driven primarily by capital deepening.

2037,," This paper presents dual estimates of total factor productivity growth (TFPG) for East Asian countries. While the dual estimates of TFPG for Korea and Hong Kong are similar to the primal estimates, they exceed the primal estimates by 1 percent a year for Taiwan and by more than 2 percent for Singapore. The reason for the large discrepancy for Singapore is because the return to capital has remained constant, despite the high rate of capital accumulation indicated by Singapore's national accounts. This discrepancy is not explained by financial market controls, capital income taxes, risk premium changes, and public investment subsidies.

2155,," We analyze politically motivated privatization in a bipartisan environment. When median-class voters a priori favor redistributive policies, a strategic privatization program allocating them enough shares can induce a voting shift away from left-wing parties whose policy would reduce the value of shareholdings. To induce median-class voters to buy enough shares to shift political preferences, strategic rationing and underpricing is often necessary. In the extreme, this may lead to free share distribution and voucher privatization. Shifting voting preferences becomes impossible when strong ex ante political constraints require large upfront transfers to insiders or when social inequality is extreme.

Nevertheless, constant growth can temporarily proceed at a faster rate, provided research intensity and educational attainment rise steadily over time.

A legislative bargaining model with endogenous grants documents a positive correlation between grant receipts and preferences for public goods; this correlation has likely biased existing work against measuring crowd-out. To correct for such endogeneity, the model motivates instruments based on the political power of state congressional delegations. Exploiting this exogenous variation in grants, the instrumental variables estimator reports crowd-out that is statistically and economically significant.

2178,D71," Committees improve decisions by pooling members' independent information, but promote manipulation, obfuscation, and exaggeration of private information when members have conflicting preferences. Committee decision procedures transform continuous data into ordered ranks through voting. This coarsens the transmission of information, but controls strategic manipulations and allows some degree of information sharing. Each member becomes more cautious in casting the crucial vote than when he alone makes the decision based on own information. Increased quality of one member's information results in his casting the crucial vote more often.

A simple model of process innovation is proposed, where firms learn about their ideal production process by making prototypes. We build around this a dynamic general-equilibrium model, and derive conditions under which diversified and specialized cities coexist. New products are developed in diversified cities, trying processes borrowed from different activities. On finding their ideal process, firms switch to mass production and relocate to specialized cities where production costs are lower. We find strong evidence of this pattern in establishment relocations across French employment areas 1993-96.","Duranton, Gilles Puga, Diego",10.1257/aer.91.5.1454,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.5.1454,2001/12,"Nursery Cities: Urban Diversity, Process Innovation, and the Life Cycle of Products",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.5.1454,2001.0,997

For each game, the treasure is a treatment in which behavior conforms nicely to predictions of the Nash equilibrium or relevant refinement. In each case, however, a change in the payoff structure produces a large inconsistency between theoretical predictions and observed behavior. These contradictions are generally consistent with simple intuition based on the interaction of payoff asymmetries and noisy introspection about others' decisions.","Goeree, Jacob K.

Europeans adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies, with different associated institutions. In places where Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and were more likely to set up extractive institutions. These institutions persisted to the present. Exploiting differences in European mortality rates as an instrument for current institutions, we estimate large effects of institutions on income per capita. Once the effect of institutions is controlled for, countries in Africa or those closer to the equator do not have lower incomes.","Acemoglu, Daron Johnson, Simon Robinson, James A.",10.1257/aer.91.5.1369,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.5.1369,2001/12,The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.5.1369,2001.0,1000

2185,G21 L13," We present a model of an unsecured loan market. Many lenders simultaneously offer loan contracts (a debt level and an interest rate) to a borrower. The borrower may accept more than one contract. Her payoff if she defaults increases in the total amount borrowed. If this payoff is high enough, deterministic zero-profit equilibria cannot be sustained. Lenders earn a positive profit, and may even charge the monopoly price. The positive-profit equilibria are robust to increases in the number of lenders.

We introduce financial-market frictions in a basic model of industry dynamics with persistent shocks and show that the combination of persistent shocks and financial frictions can account for the simultaneous dependence of firm dynamics on size (once we control for age) and on age (once we control for size).","Cooley, Thomas F.

Alternatively, in a Ricardian regime, primary surpluses are expected to respond to debt in a way that assures fiscal solvency, and the price level is determined in conventional ways.

2190,G12 O33," Why did the stock market decline so much in the early 1970s and remain low until the early 1980s? We argue that it was because information technology arrived on the scene and the stock-market incumbents of the day were not ready to implement it. Instead, new firms would bring in the new technology after the mid-1980s. Investors foresaw this in the early 1970s and stock prices fell right away. In our model, new capital destroys old capital, but with a lag.

If the assets include only capital goods and not a permanent monopoly franchise, the value of the securities measures the value of the capital. Finally, if the price of the capital can be measured or inferred, the quantity of capital is the value divided by the price.

The initially disenfranchised poor can contest power by threatening revolution, especially when the opportunity cost is low, for example, during recessions. The threat of revolution may force the elite to democratize. Democracy may not consolidate because it is redistributive, and so gives the elite an incentive to mount a coup. Highly unequal societies are less likely to consolidate democracy, and may end up oscillating between regimes and suffer substantial fiscal volatility.","Acemoglu, Daron Robinson, James A.",10.1257/aer.91.4.938,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.4.938,2001/09,A Theory of Political Transitions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.4.938,2001.0,1028

We develop a theoretical model to divide trade's impact on pollution into scale, technique, and composition effects and then examine this theory using data on sulfur dioxide concentrations. We find international trade creates relatively small changes in pollution concentrations when it alters the composition of national output. Estimates of the trade-induced technique and scale effects imply a net reduction in pollution from these sources.

An increasing returns model where varieties are linked to firms predicts home market effects: increases in a country's share of demand cause disproportionate increases in its share of output. In contrast, a constant returns model with national product differentiation predicts a less than proportionate increase.

Life-cycle models attribute this variation to differences in time preference rates, risk tolerance, exposure to uncertainty, relative tastes for work and leisure at advanced ages, and income replacement rates. These factors have testable implications concerning the relation between accumulated wealth and the shape of the consumption profile.

This paper tests whether rents fostered by regulation were shared with labor, and whether firms were discriminating by sharing these rents disproportionately with male workers. We find that average compensation and average wages for banking employees fell after states deregulated. Male wages fell by about 12 percent after deregulation, whereas women's wages fell by only 3 percent, suggesting that rents were shared mainly with men. Women's share of employment in managerial positions also increased following deregulation.","Black, Sandra E.

Using an original survey of people playing the lottery in Massachusetts in the mid-1980s, we analyze the effects of the magnitude of lottery prizes on economic behavior. The critical assumption is that among lottery winners the magnitude of the prize is randomly assigned.

First, integrated operators tend to exclude rival program services, suggesting that certain program services cannot gain access to the distribution networks of vertically integrated cable system operators. Second, vertical integration does not harm, and may actually benefit, consumers because of the associated efficiency gains.","Chipty, Tasneem",10.1257/aer.91.3.428,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.428,2001/06,"Vertical Integration, Market Foreclosure, and Consumer Welfare in the Cable Television Industry",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.428,2001.0,1059
2242,D44 Q23," When bidders anticipate an opportunity for resale trade, the value of winning an auction is determined in part by the option values of buying and selling in the secondary market. One implication is that a bidder's willingness to pay at an auction increases with the expected level of competition between resale buyers. Empirical evidence from auctions of timber contracts supports this prediction and rejects standard models that ignore resale. The estimated effect is smaller after policy changes expected to diminish the prevalence of resale. Additional evidence supports the predicted presence of a common value element introduced by the resale opportunity.","Haile, Philip A.",10.1257/aer.91.3.399,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.399,2001/06,Auctions with Resale Markets: An Application to U.S. Forest Service Timber Sales,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.399,2001.0,1060
2243,L13 L12 L41 N72," Detailed notes on weekly meetings of the sugar-refining cartel show how communication helps firms collude, and so highlight the deficiencies in the current formal theory of collusion. The Sugar Institute did not fix prices or output. Prices were increased by homogenizing business practices to make price cutting more transparent. Meetings were used to interpret and adapt the agreement, coordinate on jointly profitable actions, ensure unilateral actions were not misconstrued as cheating, and determine whether cheating had occurred. In contrast to established theories, cheating did occur, but sparked only limited retaliation, partly due to the contractual relations with selling agents.","Genesove, David Mullin, Wallace P.",10.1257/aer.91.3.379,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.379,2001/06,"Rules, Communication, and Collusion: Narrative Evidence from the Sugar Institute Case",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.379,2001.0,1061

2351,H43 D61," By incorporating the probability distribution directly into the analysis, this paper proposes a new theoretical approach to resolving the perennial dilemma of being uncertain about what discount rate to use in cost-benefit analysis. A numerical example is constructed from the results of a survey based on the opinions of 2,160 economists. The main finding is that even if every individual believes in a constant discount rate, the wide spread of opinion on what it should be makes the effective social discount rate decline significantly over time. Implications and ramifications of this proposed ""gamma-discounting"" approach are discussed.","Weitzman, Martin L.",10.1257/aer.91.1.260,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.260,2001/03,Gamma Discounting,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.260,2001.0,1169

Our survey of U.S. universities supports this view, emphasizing the embryonic state of most technologies licensed and the need for inventor cooperation in commercialization. Thus, for most university inventions, there is a moral-hazard problem with inventor effort. For such inventions, development does not occur unless the inventor's income is tied to the licensee's output by payments such as royalties or equity. Sponsored research from the licensee cannot by itself solve this problem.","Jensen, Richard Thursby, Marie",10.1257/aer.91.1.240,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.240,2001/03,Proofs and Prototypes for Sale: The Licensing of University Inventions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.240,2001.0,1170
2353,D72 H41, Politicians who care about the spoils of office may underprovide a public good because its benefits cannot be targeted to voters as easily as pork-barrel spending. We compare a winner-take-all system--where all the spoils go to the winner--to a proportional system--where the spoils of office are split among candidates proportionally to their share of the vote. In a winner-take-all system the public good is provided less often than in a proportional system when the public good is particularly desirable.

2355,E24 J64," Behind similar unemployment rates in the United States and Portugal hide two very different labor markets. Unemployment duration is three times longer in Portugal than in the United States. Symmetrically, flows of workers into unemployment are three times lower in Portugal. These lower flows come in roughly equal proportions from lower job creation and destruction, and from lower worker flows given job creation and destruction. A plausible explanation is high employment protection in Portugal. High employment protection makes economies more sclerotic; but because it affects unemployment duration and worker flows in opposite directions, the effect on unemployment is ambiguous.","Blanchard, Olivier Portugal, Pedro",10.1257/aer.91.1.187,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.187,2001/03,What Hides Behind an Unemployment Rate: Comparing Portuguese and U.S. Labor Markets,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.187,2001.0,1173
2356,E52 E31 E63," This paper characterizes conditions under which interest-rate feedback rules that set the nominal interest rate as an increasing function of the inflation rate induce aggregate instability by generating multiple equilibria. It shows that these conditions depend not only on the monetary-fiscal regime (as emphasized in the fiscal theory of the price level) but also on the way in which money is assumed to enter preferences and technology. It provides a number of examples in which, contrary to what is commonly believed, active monetary policy gives rise to multiple equilibria and passive monetary policy renders the equilibrium unique.","Benhabib, Jess Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie Uribe, Martin",10.1257/aer.91.1.167,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.167,2001/03,Monetary Policy and Multiple Equilibria,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.167,2001.0,1174

The model is consistent with the observed mean risk-free rate, equity premium, and Sharpe ratio on equity. In addition, its business-cycle implications represent a substantial improvement over the standard model. It accounts for persistence in output, comovement of employment across different sectors over the business cycle, the evidence of ""excess sensitivity"" of consumption growth to output growth, and the ""inverted leading-indicator property of interest rates,"" that interest rates are negatively correlated with future output.","Boldrin, Michele Christiano, Lawrence J.

2358,H55 D91," With fixed costs of participating in the stock market, consumers with high income will participate in the stock market, but consumers with lower income will not participate. If a fully funded defined-contribution Social Security system tries to exploit the equity premium by selling a dollar of bonds per capita and buying a dollar of equity per capita, consumers who save but do not participate in the stock market will increase their consumption, thereby reducing saving and capital accumulation. Calibration of a general-equilibrium model indicates that this policy could reduce the aggregate capital stock substantially, by about 50 cents per capita.","Abel, Andrew B.",10.1257/aer.91.1.128,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.128,2001/03,The Effects of Investing Social Security Funds in the Stock Market When Fixed Costs Prevent Some Households from Holding Stocks,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.128,2001.0,1176
2359,D91 G11," According to conventional wisdom, long-term bonds are appropriate for conservative long-term investors. This paper develops a model of optimal consumption and portfolio choice for infinite-lived investors with recursive utility who face stochastic interest rates, solves the model using an approximate analytical method, and evaluates conventional wisdom. As risk aversion increases, the myopic component of risky asset demand disappears but the intertemporal hedging component does not. Conservative investors hold assets to hedge the risk that real interest rates will decline. Long-term inflation-indexed bonds are most suitable for this purpose, but nominal bonds may also be used if inflation risk is low.","Campbell, John Y.

2360,G11 G23 H55," There is a worldwide trend toward defined contribution saving plans and growing interest in privatized Social Security plans. In both environments, individuals are given some responsibility to make their own asset-allocation decisions, raising concerns about how well they do at this task. This paper investigates one aspect of the task, namely diversification. We show that some investors follow the ""1/n strategy"": they divide their contributions evenly across the funds offered in the plan. Consistent with this naive notion of diversification, we find that the proportion invested in stocks depends strongly on the proportion of stock funds in the plan.","Benartzi, Shlomo Thaler, Richard H.",10.1257/aer.91.1.79,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.79,2001/03,Naive Diversification Strategies in Defined Contribution Saving Plans,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.79,2001.0,1178
2361,G34 G35 O16," Whereas most U.S. corporations are widely held, the predominant form of ownership in East Asia is control by a family, which often supplies a top manager. These features of ""crony capitalism"" are actually more pronounced in Western Europe. In both regions, the salient agency problem is expropriation of outside shareholders by controlling shareholders. Dividends provide evidence on this. Group-affiliated corporations in Europe pay higher dividends than in Asia, dampening insider expropriation. Dividend rates are higher in Europe, but lower in Asia, when there are multiple large shareholders, suggesting that they dampen expropriation in Europe, but exacerbate it in Asia.","Faccio, Mara Lang, Larry H.

Despite break-even discount rates exceeding 17 percent, most of the separatees selected the lump sum--saving taxpayers $1.7 billion in separation costs.

Residual-manufacturer liability distorts the market quantity when consumers' willingness to pay is correlated with their propensity to cause harm. It distorts product safety when consumers differ in their wealth levels. In both cases, consumer-only liability may be preferred.","Hay, Bruce Spier, Kathryn E.",10.1257/000282805775014416,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282805775014416,2005/12,Manufacturer Liability for Harms Caused by Consumers to Others,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282805775014416,2005.0,1204

Furthermore, questions persist about whether social capital helps mitigate information asymmetries in credit markets. I examine whether behavior in two laboratory games, Trust and a Public Goods, predicts loan repayments to a Peruvian group-lending microfinance program. Since this program relies on social capital to enforce repayment, this tests the external validity of the games. Individuals identified as ""trustworthy"" by the Trust Game are indeed less likely to default on their loans.

Since gold-pegged countries traded extensively with economies operating more flexible monetary regimes and where parity change was a common adjustment device to systemic shocks, we show that such parity adjustments induced worldwide swings in nominal effective exchange rates. These translated into real exchange rate variations to which trade balances responded with an average elasticity of unity and in the direction of restoring external disequilibria.

This paper introduces a new dataset of close to fifteen thousand innovations at the Crystal Palace World's Fair in 1851 and at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 to examine the effects of patent laws on the direction of innovation. The paper tests the following argument: if innovative activity is motivated by expected profits, and if the effectiveness of patent protection varies across industries, then innovation in countries without patent laws should focus on industries where alternative mechanisms to protect intellectual property are effective. Analyses of exhibition data for 12 countries in 1851 and 10 countries in 1876 indicate that inventors in countries without patent laws focused on a small set of industries where patents were less important, while innovation in countries with patent laws appears to be much more diversified. These findings suggest that patents help to determine the direction of technical change and that the adoption of patent laws in countries without such laws may alter existing patterns of comparative advantage across countries.","Moser, Petra",10.1257/0002828054825501,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054825501,2005/09,How Do Patent Laws Influence Innovation?

Firms are more likely to receive additional bank credit if they are in poor financial condition, because troubled Japanese banks have an incentive to allocate credit to severely impaired borrowers in order to avoid the realization of losses on their own balance sheets. This ""evergreening"" behavior is more prevalent among banks that have reported capital ratios close to the required minimum, and is compounded by the incentives arising from extensive corporate affiliations.","Peek, Joe Rosengren, Eric S.",10.1257/0002828054825691,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054825691,2005/09,Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of Credit in Japan,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054825691,2005.0,1235

These four sources are new information, and three sources of predictable consumption growth: intertemporal substitution, changes in the preferences for consumption, and incomplete markets for consumption insurance. Using household-level data, we implement this decomposition for the average growth rate of consumption expenditures on nondurable goods in the United States from 1982 to 1997. The economic importance of precautionary saving rivals that of the real interest rate, but the relative importance of each source of movement in the volatility of consumption is not precisely measured.","Parker, Jonathan A.

This paper studies utility-based biases in beliefs by supposing that beliefs maximize average felicity, optimally balancing this benefit of optimism against the costs of worse decision making. A small optimistic bias in beliefs typically leads to first-order gains in anticipatory utility and only second-order costs in realized outcomes. In a portfolio choice example, investors overestimate their return and exhibit a preference for skewness; in general equilibrium, investors' prior beliefs are endogenously heterogeneous. In a consumption-saving example, consumers are both overconfident and overoptimistic.","Brunnermeier, Markus K.

A firm committed to openness incurs higher liability and R&D costs, though product demand is not diminished.

On topics where reader beliefs diverge (such as politically divisive issues), however, newspapers segment the market and slant toward extreme positions.

Unlike analyses derived from cooperative game theory, we find that each voter's expected payoff is proportional to her voting weight. An exception occurs when many high-weight voters exist, as low-weight voters may expect disproportionately high payoffs due to proposal power. The model also predicts that, ex post, the coalition formateur (the party chosen to form a coalition) will receive a disproportionately high payoff.

2779,," Different beliefs about the fairness of social competition and what determines income inequality influence the redistributive policy chosen in a society. But the composition of income in equilibrium depends on tax policies. We show how the interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If, instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributive policies.","Alesina, Alberto Angeletos, George-Marios",10.1257/0002828054825655,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054825655,2005/09,Fairness and Redistribution,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054825655,2005.0,1243

2792,," This paper shows that price rigidity evolves in an economy populated by imperfectly rational agents who experiment with alternative rules of thumb. In the model, firms must set their prices in face of aggregate demand shocks. Their payoff depends on the level of aggregate demand, as well as on their own price and their ""neighbor's"" price. The latter assumption captures local interactions. Despite the fact that the rational expectations equilibrium (REE) is characterized by a simple pricing rule that firms can easily adopt, the economy does not converge to the REE for all parameter values. When the volatility of monetary innovations is low and interactions among firms are high, the aggregate price level exhibits rigidity, in that it does not fully react to contemporaneous aggregate demand shocks. We discuss the role of the nature of experimentation, and of path dependence driven by interactions, in explaining these results.","Saint-Paul, Gilles",10.1257/0002828054201251,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201251,2005/06,Some Evolutionary Foundations for Price Level Rigidity,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201251,2005.0,1256

Demand shocks move housing and nominal prices in the same direction, and are amplified and propagated over time. The financial accelerator is not uniform: nominal debt dampens supply shocks, stabilizing the economy under interest rate control. Structural estimation supports two key model features: collateral effects dramatically improve the response of aggregate demand to housing price shocks; and nominal debt improves the sluggish response of output to inflation surprises.

We find that for each of these years, after we control for differences in income and value-added tax (VAT) rates, there are roughly as many overpriced goods as there are underpriced goods between any two EU countries. We also find that good-by-good measures of cross-sectional price dispersion are negatively related to the tradeability of the good, and positively related to the share of non-traded inputs required to produce the good.

We use data on shipments by 126 exporting countries to 59 importing countries in 5,000 product categories to answer the question: How? Do big economies export larger quantities of each good (the intensive margin), a wider set of goods (the extensive margin), or higher-quality goods? We find that the extensive margin accounts for around 60 percent of the greater exports of larger economies. Within categories, richer countries export higher quantities at modestly higher prices. We compare these findings to some workhorse trade models. Models with Armington national product differentiation have no extensive margin, and incorrectly predict lower prices for the exports of larger economies. Models with Krugman firm-level product differentiation do feature a prominent extensive margin, but overpredict the rate at which variety responds to exporter size. Models with quality differentiation, meanwhile, can match the price facts.

Where ""initial"" political institutions (those established before 1500) placed significant checks on the monarchy, the growth of Atlantic trade strengthened merchant groups by constraining the power of the monarchy, and helped merchants obtain changes in institutions to protect property rights. These changes were central to subsequent economic growth.","Acemoglu, Daron Johnson, Simon Robinson, James",10.1257/0002828054201305,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201305,2005/06,"The Rise of Europe: Atlantic Trade, Institutional Change, and Economic Growth",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201305,2005.0,1266
2803,," We conduct experiments to explore the possibility that subject misconceptions, as opposed to a particular theory of preferences referred to as the ""endowment effect,"" account for reported gaps between willingness to pay (""WTP"") and willingness to accept (""WTA""). The literature reveals two important facts. First, there is no consensus regarding the nature or robustness of WTP-WTA gaps. Second, while experimenters are careful to control for subject misconceptions, there is no consensus about the fundamental properties of misconceptions or how to avoid them. Instead, by implementing different types of experimental controls, experimenters have revealed notions of how misconceptions arise. Experimenters have applied these controls separately or in different combinations. Such controls include ensuring subject anonymity, using incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms, and providing subjects with practice and training on the elicitation mechanism before employing it to measure valuations. The pattern of results reported in the literature suggests that the widely differing reports of WTP-WTA gaps could be due to an incomplete science regarding subject misconceptions. We implement a ""revealed theory"" methodology to compensate for the lack of a theory of misconceptions. Theories implicit in experimental procedures found in the literature are at the heart of our experimental design. Thus, our approach to addressing subject misconceptions reflects an attempt to control simultaneously for all dimensions of concern over possible subject misconceptions found in the literature. To this end, our procedures modify the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism used in previous studies to elicit values. In addition, our procedures supplement commonly used procedures by providing extensive training on the elicitation mechanism before subjects provide WTP and WTA responses. Experiments were conducted using both lotteries and mugs, goods frequently used in endowment effect experiments. Using the modified procedures, we observe no gap between WTA and WTP. Therefore, our results call into question the interpretation of observed gaps as evidence of loss aversion or prospect theory. Further evidence is required before convincing interpretations of observed gaps can be advanced.","Plott, Charles R.

2804,," We show that extrinsic or nonfundamental uncertainty influences markets in a controlled environment. This work provides the first direct evidence of sunspot equilibria. These equilibria require a common understanding of the semantics of the sunspot variable, and they appear to be sensitive to the flow of information. Sunspots always occur in a closed-book call market, but they happen only occasionally in a double auction, where inframarginal bids and offers are observable.","Duffy, John Fisher, Eric O'N.",10.1257/0002828054201350,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201350,2005/06,Sunspots in the Laboratory,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201350,2005.0,1268
2805,," We compare individuals with two-person teams in signaling game experiments. Teams consistently play more strategically than individuals and generate positive synergies in more difficult games, beating a demanding ""truth-wins"" norm. The superior performance of teams is most striking following changes in payoffs that change the equilibrium outcome. Individuals play less strategically following the change in payoffs than inexperienced subjects playing the same game. In contrast, the teams exhibit positive learning transfer, playing more strategically following the change than inexperienced subjects. Dialogues between teammates are used to identify factors promoting strategic play.","Cooper, David J.

2917,," This paper studies how to protect future generations from expropriation and to induce optimal investment in intergenerational public goods (IPGs), by introducing constitutional restrictions on the tax base. The type of tax-base restrictions that we consider places limits on the tax instruments that the government can use to raise revenue, but not on the level of expenditures or debt. We show that the introduction of a constitutional amendment requiring that IPGs and debt be financed with land taxes makes intergenerational expropriation impossible and, for many cases of interest, induces optimal investment in IPGs. We also show that a weaker constitutional amendment requiring that IPGs be financed with land taxes, but imposing no restrictions on how to finance the debt, has a positive impact on IPGs, but not on expropriation. The paper also studies the political feasibility of these reforms. We show that the first reform is not politically feasible since it hurts current generations, but the weaker reform can induce a Pareto improvement.","Rangel, Antonio",10.1257/0002828053828527,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828527,2005/03,How to Protect Future Generations Using Tax-Base Restrictions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828527,2005.0,1381
2918,," Transport time increases with distance traveled, and time is valuable. We show the implications of these facts for global specialization and trade: products where timely delivery is important will be produced near the source of final demand, where wages will be higher as a result. In the model, timely delivery is important because it allows retailers to respond to final demand fluctuations without holding costly inventories, and timely delivery is possible only from nearby locations. Using a unique dataset that allows us to measure the retail demand for timely delivery, we show that the sources of U.S. apparel imports have shifted in the way predicted by the model, with products for which timeliness matters increasingly imported from nearby countries.","Evans, Carolyn L.

2919,," GDP per capita is usually used to proxy for the quality of life of individuals living in different countries. Welfare is also affected by quantity of life, however, as represented by longevity. This paper incorporates longevity into an overall assessment of the evolution of cross-country inequality and shows that it is quantitatively important. The absence of reduction in cross-country inequality up to the 1990s documented in previous work is in stark contrast to the reduction in inequality after incorporating gains in longevity. Throughout the post–World War II period, health contributed to reduce significantly welfare inequality across countries. This paper derives valuation formulas for infra-marginal changes in longevity and computes a ""full"" growth rate that incorporates the gains in health experienced by 96 countries for the period between 1960 and 2000. Incorporating longevity gains changes traditional results; countries starting with lower income tended to grow faster than countries starting with higher income. We estimate an average yearly growth in ""full income"" of 4.1 percent for the poorest 50 percent of countries in 1960, of which 1.7 percentage points are due to health, as opposed to a growth of 2.6 percent for the richest 50 percent of countries, of which only 0.4 percentage points are due to health. Additionally, we decompose changes in life expectancy into changes attributable to 13 broad groups of causes of death and three age groups. We show that mortality from infectious, respiratory, and digestive diseases, congenital, perinatal, and ""ill-defined"" conditions, mostly concentrated before age 20 and between ages 20 and 50, is responsible for most of the reduction in life expectancy inequality. At the same time, the recent effect of AIDS, together with reductions in mortality after age 50—due to nervous system, senses organs, heart and circulatory diseases—contributed to increase health inequality across countries.","Becker, Gary S.

2920,," Relative purchasing power parity (PPP) holds for pure price inflations, which affect prices of all goods and services by the same proportion, while leaving relative prices unchanged.

Recognizing that relative PPP may not hold for the official inflation data constructed from commodity price indices because of relative price changes and other frictions that cause prices to be ""sticky,"" we provide a novel method for extracting a proxy for realized pure price inflation from stock returns.

2921,," This paper shows that a country's wealth can be an important determinant of comparative advantage when access to credit differs across sectors of the economy. Wealthier nations exhibit a comparative advantage toward goods produced in sectors facing more severe financial imperfections. These sectors are typically populated by small firms. Empirically this paper documents that these sectors are also labor intensive. Consequently, this theory partially offsets traditional sources of comparative advantage and offers an explanation for Trefler's missing trade mystery and the Leontief paradox.

2924,," This paper introduces methods to compute impulse responses without specification and estimation of the underlying multivariate dynamic system. The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages.","Jordà, Òscar",10.1257/0002828053828518,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828518,2005/03,Estimation and Inference of Impulse Responses by Local Projections,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828518,2005.0,1388

The return-forecasting factor is countercyclical and forecasts stock returns. An important component of the return-forecasting factor is unrelated to the level, slope, and curvature movements described by most term structure models.

2926,," Prevalent thinking about liquidity traps suggests that the perfect substitutability of money and bonds at a zero short-term nominal interest rate renders open-market operations ineffective for achieving macroeconomic stabilization goals. We show that even were this the case, there remains a powerful argument for large-scale open market operations as a fiscal policy tool. As we also demonstrate, however, this same reasoning implies that open-market operations will be beneficial for stabilization as well, even when the economy is expected to remain mired in a liquidity trap for some time. Thus, the microeconomic fiscal benefits of open-market operations in a liquidity trap go hand in hand with standard macroeconomic objectives. Motivated by Japan's recent economic experience, we use a dynamic general-equilibrium model to assess the welfare impact of open-market operations for an economy in Japan's predicament. We argue Japan can achieve a substantial welfare improvement through large open-market purchases of domestic government debt.","Auerbach, Alan J.

2928,," What accounts for the worldwide advance of financial reforms in the last quarter century? Using a new index of financial liberalization, we find that influential events shook the policy status quo. Balance-of-payments crises spurred reforms, but banking crises set liberalization back. Falling global interest rates strengthened reformers, while new governments went both ways. The overall trend toward liberalization, however, reflected pressures and incentives generated by initial reforms that raised the likelihood of additional reforms, stimulated further by the need to catch up with regional reform leaders. In contrast, ideology and country structure had limited influence.","Abiad, Abdul Mody, Ashoka",10.1257/0002828053828699,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828699,2005/03,Financial Reform: What Shakes It?

2929,," Following a recession, the aggregate labor market is slack–employment remains below normal and recruiting efforts of employers, as measured by help-wanted advertising and vacancies, are low. A model of matching friction explains the qualitative responses of the labor market to adverse shocks, but requires implausibly large shocks to account for the magnitude of observed fluctuations. The incorporation of wage stickiness vastly increases the sensitivity of the model to driving forces. I develop a new model of the way that wage stickiness affects unemployment. The stickiness arises in an economic equilibrium and satisfies the condition that no worker-employer pair has an unexploited opportunity for mutual improvement. Sticky wages neither interfere with the efficient formation of employment matches nor cause inefficient job loss. Thus the model provides an answer to the fundamental criticism previously directed at sticky-wage models of fluctuations.","Hall, Robert E.",10.1257/0002828053828482,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828482,2005/03,Employment Fluctuations with Equilibrium Wage Stickiness,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828482,2005.0,1393
2930,," This paper argues that the textbook search and matching model cannot generate the observed business-cycle-frequency fluctuations in unemployment and job vacancies in response to shocks of a plausible magnitude. In the United States, the standard deviation of the vacancy-unemployment ratio is almost 20 times as large as the standard deviation of average labor productivity, while the search model predicts that the two variables should have nearly the same volatility. A shock that changes average labor productivity primarily alters the present value of wages, generating only a small movement along a downward-sloping Beveridge curve (unemployment-vacancy locus). A shock to the separation rate generates a counterfactually positive correlation between unemployment and vacancies. In both cases, the model exhibits virtually no propagation.","Shimer, Robert",10.1257/0002828053828572,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828572,2005/03,The Cyclical Behavior of Equilibrium Unemployment and Vacancies,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828572,2005.0,1394

For example, the fears induced by the possibility of failure or of negative evaluations have physiological consequences (shaking, loss of concentration) that may impair performance in sports, on stage, or at school. There is also ample evidence that individuals have distorted recollection of past events and distorted attributions of the causes of success or failure. Recollection of good events or successes is typically easier than recollection of bad ones or failures. Successes tend to be attributed to intrinsic aptitudes or effort, while failures are attributed to bad luck. In addition, these attributions are often reversed when judging the performance of others.

2949,," In this paper I suggest a unified explanation for two puzzles in the inventory literature: first, estimates of inventory speeds of adjustment in aggregate data are very small relative to the apparent rapid reaction of stocks to unanticipated variations in sales. Second, estimates of inventory speeds of adjustment in firm-level data are significantly higher than in aggregate data. The paper develops a multisector model where inventories are held to avoid stockouts, and price markups vary along the business cycle. The omission of countercyclical markup variations from inventory targets introduces a downward bias in estimates of adjustment speeds obtained from partial adjustment models. When the cyclicality of markups differs across sectors, this downward bias is shown to be more severe with aggregate rather than firm-level data. Similar results apply not only to inventories, but also to labor and prices. Montercarlo simulations of a calibrated version of the model suggest that these biases are quantitatively significant.","Coen-Pirani, Daniele",10.1257/0002828043052376,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828043052376,2004/12,"Markups, Aggregation, and Inventory Adjustment",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828043052376,2004.0,1413

The model, however, predicts that inventories will respond to long-run movements, that is, to regime shifts in the real interest rate.

We first document that fund returns, both before and after fees and expenses, decline with lagged fund size, even after accounting for various performance benchmarks. We then explore a number of potential explanations for this relationship. This association is most pronounced among funds that have to invest in small and illiquid stocks, suggesting that these adverse scale effects are related to liquidity. Controlling for its size, a fund's return does not deteriorate with the size of the family that it belongs to, indicating that scale need not be bad for performance depending on how the fund is organized.

We break the beta of a stock with the market portfolio into two components, one reflecting news about the market's future cash flows and one reflecting news about the market's discount rates. Intertemporal asset pricing theory suggests that the former should have a higher price of risk; thus beta, like cholesterol, comes in ""bad"" and ""good"" varieties. Empirically, we find that value stocks and small stocks have considerably higher cash-flow betas than growth stocks and large stocks, and this can explain their higher average returns. The poor performance of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) since 1963 is explained by the fact that growth stocks and high-past-beta stocks have predominantly good betas with low risk prices.","Campbell, John Y.

We test this prediction using a difference-in-difference gravity specification that controls for import tariffs, importing-country remoteness, home bias in demand, and the tendency for large countries to export more of all goods. We find strong evidence of home-market effects whose intensity varies across industries in a manner consistent with theory.","Hanson, Gordon H.

2963,," If individuals care about their status, defined as their rank in the distribution of consumption of one ""positional"" good, then the consumer's problem is strategic as her utility depends on the consumption choices of others. In the symmetric Nash equilibrium, each individual spends an inefficiently high amount on the status good. Using techniques from auction theory, we analyze the effects of exogenous changes in the distribution of income. In a richer society, almost all individuals spend more on conspicuous consumption, and individual utility is lower at each income level. In a more equal society, the poor are worse off.","Hopkins, Ed Kornienko, Tatiana",10.1257/0002828042002705,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828042002705,2004/09,Running to Keep in the Same Place: Consumer Choice as a Game of Status,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002705,2004.0,1427

This series is regressed on the Federal Reserve's internal forecasts to derive a measure free of systematic responses to information about future developments.

The fundamental intuition, that opportunity and responsibility have moral value, is formalized as an ""opportunity criterion"" for assessing resource allocation systems. A model of an exchange economy is presented in which rational arbitrageurs compete to make profits by trading with nonrational consumers. In equilibrium, this economy satisfies the opportunity criterion.

Subsequent work that revisited his calculation continued to find small welfare benefits, further reinforcing the perception that business cycles do not matter. This paper argues instead that fluctuations can affect welfare, by affecting the growth rate of consumption. I show that fluctuations can reduce growth starting from a given initial consumption, which can imply substantial welfare effects as Lucas himself observed.

To assess these effects in a tractable general-equilibrium framework, we introduce endogenous search frictions, in the spirit of Peter Diamond (1990), in both credit and labor markets. We demonstrate that credit frictions amplify macroeconomic volatility through a financial accelerator. The magnitude of this general-equilibrium accelerator is proportional to the credit gap, defined as the deviation of actual output from its perfect credit market level.

Partnership contracts, in which agents agree in advance to the allocation of opportunities and of the revenues they generate, support referrals where the market cannot, but often at the expense of distortions on those opportunities that are not referred.","Garicano, Luis Santos, Tano",10.1257/0002828041464506,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464506,2004/06,Referrals,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464506,2004.0,1458
2995,," This paper reports an experimental test of how individuals learn from the behavior of others. By using techniques only available in the laboratory, we elicit subjects' beliefs. This allows us to distinguish informational cascades from herd behavior. By adding a setup with continuous signal and discrete action, we enrich the ball-andurn observational learning experiments paradigm of Lisa R. Anderson and Charles Holt (1997). We attempt to understand subjects' behavior by estimating a model that allows for the possibility of errors in earlier decisions.","Çelen, Boğaçhan Kariv, Shachar",10.1257/0002828041464461,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464461,2004/06,Distinguishing Informational Cascades from Herd Behavior in the Laboratory,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464461,2004.0,1459
2996,," Governments can efficiently provide liquidity, as when the banking system is bailed out. We study a model in which not all assets can be used to purchase all other assets at every date. Agents sometimes want to sell projects. The market price of the projects sold depends on the supply of liquidity, which is determined in general equilibrium. While private liquidity provision is socially beneficial since it allows valuable reallocations, it is also socially costly since liquidity suppliers could have made more efficient investments ex ante. There is a role for the government to supply liquidity by issuing government securities.","Gorton, Gary Huang, Lixin",10.1257/0002828041464650,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464650,2004/06,"Liquidity, Efficiency, and Bank Bailouts",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464650,2004.0,1460
2997,," We develop a model where agents obtain information about job opportunities through an explicitly modeled network of social contacts. We show that employment is positively correlated across time and agents. Moreover, unemployment exhibits duration dependence: the probability of obtaining a job decreases in the length of time that an agent has been unemployed. Finally, we examine inequality between two groups. If staying in the labor market is costly and one group starts with a worse employment status, then that group's drop-out rate will be higher and their employment prospects will be persistently below that of the other group.","Calvó-Armengol, Antoni Jackson, Matthew O.",10.1257/0002828041464542,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464542,2004/06,The Effects of Social Networks on Employment and Inequality,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464542,2004.0,1461

Because every country faces its own national budget constraint, the Diamond-Mirrlees production-efficiency theorem, which underlies key tenets of policy advice in international taxation - the desirability of destination basis for commodity taxation, of the residence principle for capital income taxation, and of free trade - does not apply. The paper establishes conditions - relating to the availability of explicit or implicit devices for reallocating tax revenues across countries - under which production efficiency is nevertheless desirable, and characterizes the precise ways in which Pareto-efficient international taxation may require violation of established tenets.","Keen, Michael Wildasin, David",10.1257/000282804322970797,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282804322970797,2004/03,Pareto-Efficient International Taxation,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282804322970797,2004.0,1573

Because the majority of households that leave high-rise public housing in response to the demolitions move to neighborhoods and schools that closely resemble those they left, the zero effect of the demolitions may be interpreted as the independent impact of public housing.","Jacob, Brian A.",10.1257/000282804322970788,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282804322970788,2004/03,"Public Housing, Housing Vouchers, and Student Achievement: Evidence from Public Housing Demolitions in Chicago",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282804322970788,2004.0,1574
3111,," Using the December 1998 and August 2000 CPS Computer and Internet Supplements matched with subsequent CPS files, we ask which types of unemployed workers looked for work on line and whether Internet searchers became reemployed more quickly. In our data, Internet searchers have observed characteristics that are typically associated with shorter unemployment spells, and do spend less time unemployed. This unemployment differential is however eliminated and in some cases reversed when we hold observable characteristics constant. We conclude that either Internet job search is ineffective in reducing unemployment durations, or Internet job searchers are negatively selected on unobservables.","Kuhn, Peter Skuterud, Mikal",10.1257/000282804322970779,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282804322970779,2004/03,Internet Job Search and Unemployment Durations,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282804322970779,2004.0,1575

According to the estimated model, U.S. monetary policy post-1982 is consistent with determinacy, whereas the pre-Volcker policy is not.

3114,, Antidumping (AD) trade protection policies allow government agencies to recalculate AD duties based on foreign firms' most recent pricing behavior. We examine the resulting dynamic pricing problem of a foreign firm facing such policy. We show that the expected pattern of AD duty recalculations over time crucially depends on the foreign firm's ex ante expectations of possible outcomes of AD policy enforcement. Our empirical analysis then confirms the role of ex ante expectations in explaining observed patterns of AD recalculations. Many of our model's results are applicable to other situations where enforcement of policy is tied to the subject's behavior.,"Blonigen, Bruce A.

3116,, This paper examines how factor proportions determine the structure of commodity trade. It integrates a many-country version of a Heckscher-Ohlin model with a continuum of goods with Paul R. Krugman's (1980) model of monopolistic competition and transport costs. The commodity structure of production and bilateral trade is fully determined. Two main predictions emerge. Countries capture larger shares of world production and trade of commodities that more intensively use their abundant factors. Countries that rapidly accumulate a factor see their production and export structures systematically shift towards industries that intensively use that factor. Both predictions receive support from detailed trade data.,"Romalis, John",10.1257/000282804322970715,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282804322970715,2004/03,Factor Proportions and the Structure of Commodity Trade,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282804322970715,2004.0,1580

3119,," An important challenge in the crime literature is to isolate causal effects of police on crime. Following a terrorist attack on the main Jewish center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994, all Jewish institutions received police protection. Thus, this hideous event induced a geographical allocation of police forces that can be presumed exogenous in a crime regression. Using data on the location of car thefts before and after the attack, we find a large deterrent effect of observable police on crime. The effect is local, with no appreciable impact outside the narrow area in which the police are deployed.","Di Tella, Rafael Schargrodsky, Ernesto",10.1257/000282804322970733,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282804322970733,2004/03,Do Police Reduce Crime?

First, the nonanonymity of the dynastic link allows to sanction the defaulters' offspring and induce compliance even in short-term interactions (social enforcement). Second, preferential agreements can arise in which kin members condition their behavior on the characteristics of a player's predecessor, expecting others to do the same with their offspring (reciprocity).

Given the secular decline in mobility costs, these predictions can be evaluated using historical data.

3160,," We develop a new theoretical link between inequality and growth. In our model, fertility and education decisions are interdependent. Poor parents decide to have many children and invest little in education. A mean-preserving spread in the income distribution increases the fertility differential between the rich and the poor, which implies that more weight gets placed on families who provide little education.

3162,," This paper explores the general-equilibrium impact of social security portfolio diversification into private securities, either through the trust fund or private accounts. The analysis depends critically on heterogeneities in saving, production, assets, and taxes. Limited diversification weakly increases interest rates, reduces the expected return on short-term investment (and the equity premium), decreases safe investment, increases risky investment, and increases a suitably weighted social welfare function. However, the effects on aggregate investment, long-term capital values, and the utility of young savers hinges on assumptions about technology. Aggregate investment and long-term asset values can move in opposite directions.

3230,," This essay examines interconnections between ""race"" and economic inequality in the United States, focusing on the case of African-Americans. I will argue that it is crucially important to distinguish between racial discrimination and racial stigma in the study of this problem. Racial discrimination has to do with how blacks are treated, while racial stigma is concerned with how black people are perceived. My view is that what I call reward bias (unfair treatment of persons in formal economic transactions based on racial identity) is now a less significant barrier to the full participation by African-Americans in U.S. society than is what I will call development bias (blocked access to resources critical for personal development but available only via non-market-mediated social transactions). By making these points in the specific cultural and historical context of the black experience in U.S. society, I hope to contribute to a deeper conceptualization of the worldwide problem of race and economic marginality.","Loury, Glenn C.",10.1257/000282803321947308,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947308,2003/05,Racial Stigma: Toward a New Paradigm for Discrimination Theory,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947308,2003.0,1694

3240,," At least 41 million Americans are currently without health insurance in any given month (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2002). They are uninsured for a variety of reasons, and most people who lack coverage are affected by more than one reason. Two generalizations can be made, however. First, a majority simply cannot afford to purchase health insurance unless it is heavily subsidized. Most do not have access to employer-sponsored coverage and so must purchase any insurance in the non-group (individual) health-insurance market - a market where, as I explain below, insurance is typically twice as expensive as employer-group coverage if it is not denied outright. Since about two-thirds of the uninsured have incomes below $35,000, non-group health-insurance premiums often exceed 10 percent of their incomes. The second generalization is that, to an important extent, high premiums in the non-group market and denial of coverage reflect market failure due to asymmetric information. Insurers can never know as much as an individual does about his or her health, family history of health problems, and tendency to seek medical care. Because of this asymmetry, it is impossible for an insurer to set premiums that accurately reflect the non-random portion of health-care costs for different individuals. The non-group market is the only health-insurance option for people without employersponsored coverage. Tax-related subsidies as proposed by members of Congress and the Bush administration do not address the market-failure problems and so are unlikely to make insurance much more affordable. To increase access to health insurance, risk in the non-group market needs to be shifted to a broader population base. In what follows, I first describe the three distinct health-insurance markets in which people can obtain health insurance, and the special nature of competition among insurance companies in the non-group market. Then I make the case for government to act as reinsurer and assume the risk of extremely high-cost people. Efficiency in the non-group health-insurance market would be improved if the government reinsured the market. Equity also would be increased if the government acted as reinsurer because more uninsured people would have access to insurance. Finally, I describe precedents for this role for government in other markets, and why tax-related subsidies will not succeed in increasing health-insurance coverage unless the risks of extremely high costs are shifted to the government.","Swartz, Katherine",10.1257/000282803321947209,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947209,2003/05,Reinsuring Risk to Increase Access to Health Insurance,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947209,2003.0,1704
3241,," The persistently large number of uninsured, roughly 40 million per year since 1993, continues to elicit bipartisan policy interest. Coverage-expansion proposals without mandates, by far the most common since the defeat of the Clinton plan, must address risk-pooling realities in private markets. Insurers have strong financial incentives to segment risks and minimize pooling of heterogeneous risks, and narrow risk-pooling will diminish the adequacy of premium subsidies based on income alone, at least for higher-risk individuals. The current debate over flat tax credits and the non-group market is a case in point (Blumberg, 2001; Center for Studying Health System Change, 2002; Jack Hadley and James D. Reschovsky, 2002). We, along with nine other teams, were asked to develop a proposal that would expand coverage in a large and creative way (see Holahan et al., 2001). The proposal we developed would subsidize low-income individuals and families but also addresses the issue of inefficient and inequitable risk-pooling.","Holahan, John Nichols, Len M. Blumberg, Linda J. Shen, Yu-Chu",10.1257/000282803321947191,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947191,2003/05,A New Approach to Risk-Spreading via Coverage-Expansion Subsidies,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947191,2003.0,1705
3242,," After a small decline, the number of uninsured persons in the United States is on the rise again, at over 41 million (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2002). This increase is likely to spur efforts to cover the uninsured through legislative action. Given the failure of the most recent attempt at massive insurance expansions (David Cutler and Gruber, 2002), the likely approach is through incremental reforms. At the same time, there remains a fundamental conflict between the right and the left over the appropriate form that such incremental reforms should take. The left advocates additional expansions of the public-insurance safety net, for example, to parents of children already publicly insured. The right advocates subsidizing the purchase of private insurance through the tax code. In recent years, a number of analyses, both inside and outside of government, have studied the impact of these types of reforms (e.g., John Holahan et al., 1999; Gruber and Larry Levitt, 2000; Mark McClellan, 2000). These analyses have largely talked past each other, however, as there is little agreement on the ""right"" criteria on which to evaluate incremental reforms. Should we be concerned solely with the number of persons newly insured? What about the extent of displacement of other forms of insurance coverage, or ""crowdout""? And what about the types of uninsured covered; should we count equally a low-cost child who is newly insured and a high-cost older person? In this paper, I lay out the issues surrounding the criteria along which alternative approaches to reform can be evaluated. I then present microsimulation estimates of the impacts of three types of reforms: tax credits for individual purchase of nongroup insurance, expansions of public insurance to children and parents, and expansion of public insurance to all adults. I use the results from these simulations to contrast these reforms using the various criteria developed here.","Gruber, Jonathan",10.1257/000282803321947182,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947182,2003/05,Evaluating Alternative Approaches to Incremental Health-Insurance Expansion,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947182,2003.0,1706
3243,," Following the financial crises of the late 1990's an increasing number of emergingmarket countries have adopted a flexible exchange-rate regime and an inflation-targeting monetary-policy framework. This trend has generated a growing debate on the appropriate monetary-policy rule for ""financially fragile"" economies with thin and incomplete financial markets that are subject to highly volatile capital flows. Within this context, I examine the implications of alternative monetary-policy rules and the choice of instruments and targets in a small open economy with imperfect capital markets. I compare a benchmark efficient-markets model with a monetary-targeting regime and three different inflation-targeting rules: the Taylor rule, a CPI inflation-target rule, and a non-tradable inflation-target rule. Furthermore, I study how sensitive the results are to varying degrees of capital-market integration. In addressing this question of the ""second best"" policy, the paper resembles that of Michael Devereaux and Phillip Lane (2001), who study the role of financial accelerator effects on various monetary-policy rules. I adopt a small open-economy setup rather than a two-country framework. In contrast to most small open-economy models, however, this paper does not assume a zero current-account balance. Net foreign-asset holdings and capital flows affect real volatility through the interest-rate risk premium. Given the significant role the risk premium plays in the external borrowing costs for emerging markets, this channel may have important consequences for economic dynamics.","Tuladhar, Anita",10.1257/000282803321947173,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947173,2003/05,Monetary Policy Under Imperfect Capital Markets in a Small Open Economy,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947173,2003.0,1707

3245,," Global aging is prompting workers and taxpayers everywhere to recognize their vulnerability to the inherent uncertainty of unfunded social-security systems. This has generated an international wave of social-security reforms over the last two decades, prompting more than 20 countries to establish Individual Account (IA) plans. In the United States, the idea of Individual Accounts has attracted recent interest with the release of the Final Report of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS): here, voluntary individual accounts were proposed as a key element of a reformed national old-age system (see Commission to Strengthen Social Security, 2001; John F. Cogan and Mitchell, 2003). Strengths of IA's include the fact that participants gain ownership in their accounts and diversify their pension investments; nevertheless, IA participants also must bear capital-market risk. Recent market volatility has reminded investors of the importance of capital-market fluctuations and their potential impact on retirement income. In response, some policymakers have suggested that ""guarantees"" be designed to help protect IA investments. Abroad, such guarantees have been adopted in several Latin American countries undergoing reform, and most recently, in Japan and Germany (Mitchell and Kent Smetters, 2003). Sensible public policy recommending the adoption of guarantees must identify their costs and who will pay for them. In this paper, we discuss how to evaluate such costs in the context of a social-security reform that includes IA's, along with ways to finance them.","Lachance, Marie-Eve Mitchell, Olivia S.",10.1257/000282803321947155,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947155,2003/05,Guaranteeing Individual Accounts,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947155,2003.0,1709

3252,," The Industrial Revolution is a topic of renewed interest for growth economists. After the first wave of ""new growth"" theory that addressed the causes of sustained increases in productivity, more attention has been given to an important additional stylized fact: that rapid growth itself is new in historical terms. A radical discontinuity separates thousands of years of by and large stagnant living standards from the industrial era. Increasingly in the last few years, models have attempted to capture these long-run dynamics to try to explain how the world changed from a state where growth was fleeting and limited to one where it has become permanent and decisive. At the same time, economic historians have re-evaluated changes in living standards during the British Industrial Revolution (the canonical case). The new picture that emerges has become increasingly consistent over the last decade, and it differs drastically from earlier descriptions. This paper briefly summarizes the two literatures, contrasts the results obtained, and makes suggestions for a new set of ""stylized facts"" that could usefully guide future theoretical and empirical work on the Industrial Revolution.","Voth, Hans-Joachim",10.1257/000282803321947083,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947083,2003/05,Living Standards During the Industrial Revolution: An Economist's Guide,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947083,2003.0,1716

3255,," This paper synthesizes findings from an ongoing research program on learning in signaling games. The present paper focuses on crossgame learning (the ability of subjects to take what has been learned in one game and generalize it to related games), an issue that has been ignored in most of the learning literature. We begin by laying out the basic experimental design and recapitulating early results characterizing the learning process. We then report results from an initial experiment in which we find a surprising degree of positive cross-game learning, contrary to the predictions of commonly employed learning models and to the findings of cognitive psychologists. We next explore two features of the environment that help to explain when and why this positive transfer occurs. First, we examine the effects of abstract versus meaningful context, an issue that has been largely ignored by economists out of the belief that behavior is largely dictated by the deep mathematical structure of a game. In contrast, results from cognitive psychology suggest that behavior may well be sensitive to context employed. Our results show that the use of meaningful context serves as a catalyst for positive transfer. Second, we explore how play by two-person teams differs from play by individuals. The psychology literature is quite pessimistic about the ability of teams to beat a ""truth wins"" standard based on performance of individuals. But teams easily surpass this norm in our cross-game experiment. We use the dialogues between team members to gain insight into how this transfer occurs, gaining direct confirmation for hypotheses generated by econometric analysis of earlier data.","Cooper, David J.

Hundreds of experiments show that in actual behavior these three forces are limited, even when subjects are highly motivated and analytically skilled (Camerer, 2003). The challenge is to create models that are as general, precise, and parsimonious as equilibrium, but which also use cognitive details to explain experimental evidence more accurately and to predict new regularities.

3262,," My first exposure to the psychological assumptions of economics was in a report that Bruno Frey wrote on that subject in the early 1970's. Its first or second sentence stated that the agent of economic theory is rational and selfish, and that his tastes do not change. I found this list quite startling, because I had been professionally trained as a psychologist not to believe a word of it. The gap between the assumptions of our disciplines appeared very large indeed. Has the gap been narrowed in the intervening 30 years? A search through some introductory textbooks in economics indicates that if there has been any change, it has not yet filtered down to that level: the same assumptions are still in place as the cornerstones of economic analysis. However, a behavioral approach to economics has emerged in which the assumptions are not held sacrosanct. In the following I comment selectively on the developments with regard to the three assumptions, on both sides of the disciplinary divide.","Kahneman, Daniel",10.1257/000282803321946985,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321946985,2003/05,A Psychological Perspective on Economics,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321946985,2003.0,1726
3263,," Inviting political scientists to tell economists how they could do better work is an act of disciplinary generosity. The reality is that contemporary political science is a net importer of ideas and methods from other disciplines, and from none more than economics. Indeed, some of the most exciting research in political science in the past 40 years has involved the incorporation of ideas from economics. We have neither the space nor the mandate to summarize that research here, but refer interested readers to Gary J. Miller's (1997) extensive review. Our aim here is to offertwo modest case studies of specific instances of overlap between the interests and research efforts of economists and political scientists. Our first case study focuses on describing and explaining participation in the workforce, the polity, and many other social activities and organizations. Our second case study focuses on the impact of political processes and institutions on macroeconomic policies and performance. In both these instances the work of economists has been quite fruitful—but also, we think, hampered by a characteristic overreliance on standard economic models and methods. However, in both areas, recent developments may point the way toward a more constructive research style combining the theoretical and empirical rigor of economics with a broader and more eclectic approach familiar to political scientists.","Bartels, Larry M.

3265,," Strong and widely accepted evidence shows that the natural rate of unemployment varies over time with substantial amplitude. The frictions in the labor market that account for positive normal levels of unemployment are not simple and mechanical. Instead, as a rich modern body of theory demonstrates, the natural rate of unemployment is an equilibrium in which the volumes of job-seeking by workers and worker-seeking by employers reach a balance controlled by fundamental determinants of the relative prices of the two activities. In recessions, unemployment rises, and job vacancies fall. The natural explanation is an economywide fall in labor demand. But a compelling model that generates a fall in labor demand without a counterfactual fall in productivity has eluded theorists to date. Nonetheless, policymakers have appropriately adopted the view that the natural rate varies over time and is not a simple benchmark for setting monetary instruments.","Hall, Robert E.",10.1257/000282803321946958,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321946958,2003/05,Modern Theory of Unemployment Fluctuations: Empirics and Policy Applications,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321946958,2003.0,1729

We use a general-equilibrium model as a tool to discriminate between two alternative explanations: (i) a change in the nature of real shocks, and (ii) an increase in U.S. financial integration with the rest of the world. Our results indicate that financial integration has played the major role in producing the observed changes in international co-movement.","Heathcote, Jonathan Perri, Fabrizio",10.1257/000282803321946813,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321946813,2003/05,Why Has the U.S. Economy Become Less Correlated with the Rest of the World?,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321946813,2003.0,1743

3308,," This paper extends the standard principal-agent model to allow for subjective evaluation.

Moreover, discrimination against an individual implies lower pay and performance, suggesting that the extent of discrimination as measured after controlling for performance may underestimate the level of true discrimination. Finally, the optimal contract entails the use of bonus pay rather than the threat of dismissal, hence neither ""efficiency wages"" nor the right to dismiss an employee are necessary ingredients for an optimal incentive contract.",Bentley MacLeod W.,10.1257/000282803321455232,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321455232,2003/03,Optimal Contracting with Subjective Evaluation,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455232,2003.0,1772
3309,," We study nearly 7,000 retirement accounts during the April 1994-August 1998 period. Several interesting patterns emerge. Most asset allocations are extreme (either 100 percent or zero percent in equities) and there is inertia in asset allocations. Equity allocations are higher for males, married investors, and for investors with higher earnings and more seniority on the job; equity allocations are lower for older investors. There is very limited portfolio reshuffling, in sharp contrast to discount brokerage accounts. Daily changes in equity allocations correlate only weakly with same-day equity returns and do not correlate with future equity returns.","Agnew, Julie Balduzzi, Pierluigi Sundén, Annika",10.1257/000282803321455223,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321455223,2003/03,Portfolio Choice and Trading in a Large 401(k) Plan,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455223,2003.0,1773
3310,," Gravity equations have been widely used to infer trade flow effects of various institutional arrangements. We show that estimated gravity equations do not have a theoretical foundation.

We apply the method to solve the famous McCallum border puzzle. Applying our method, we find that national borders reduce trade between industrialized countries by moderate amounts of 20-50 percent.","Anderson, James E. van Wincoop, Eric",10.1257/000282803321455214,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321455214,2003/03,Gravity with Gravitas: A Solution to the Border Puzzle,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455214,2003.0,1774

These societies feature huge intergenerational resource flows, suggesting that these resource flows should replace fertility as the key demographic consideration. It is then theoretically expected that life expectancy and brain size would increase simultaneously, as apparently occurred during our evolutionary history.

3312,," Starting from an example of the Allies' decision to feint at Calais and attack Normandy on D-Day, this paper models misrepresentation of intentions to competitors or enemies. Allowing for the possibility of bounded strategic rationality and rational players' responses to it yields a sensible account of lying via costless, noiseless messages. In some leading cases, the model has generically unique pure-strategy sequential equilibria, in which rational players exploit boundedly rational players, but are not themselves fooled. In others, the model has generically essentially unique mixed-strategy sequential equilibria, in which rational players' strategies protect all players from exploitation.","Crawford, Vincent P.",10.1257/000282803321455197,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321455197,2003/03,Lying for Strategic Advantage: Rational and Boundedly Rational Misrepresentation of Intentions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455197,2003.0,1776

In addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment.

3314,," This paper provides an analytical characterization of Markov perfect equilibria in a model with repeated voting, where agents vote over distortionary income redistribution. A key result is that the future constituency for redistributive policies depends positively on current redistribution, since this affects both private investments and the future distribution of voters. The model features multiple equilibria. In some equilibria, positive redistribution persists forever.

3315,," This paper studies the evolution of sectoral concentration in relation to the level of per capita income. We show that various measures of sectoral concentration follow a U-shaped pattern across a wide variety of data sources: countries first diversify, in the sense that economic activity is spread more equally across sectors, but there exists, relatively late in the development process, a point at which they start specializing again. We discuss this finding in light of existing theories of trade and growth, which generally predict a monotonic relationship between income and diversification.","Imbs, Jean Wacziarg, Romain",10.1257/000282803321455160,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321455160,2003/03,Stages of Diversification,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455160,2003.0,1779
3316,," Using a new data set consisting of six years of real-time exchange-rate quotations, macroeconomic expectations, and macroeconomic realizations, we characterize the conditional means of U.S. dollar spot exchange rates. In particular, we find that announcement surprises produce conditional mean jumps; hence high-frequency exchange-rate dynamics are linked to fundamentals. The details of the linkage are intriguing and include announcement timing and sign effects. The sign effect refers to the fact that the market reacts to news in an asymmetric fashion: bad news has greater impact than good news, which we relate to recent theoretical work on information processing and price discovery.","Andersen, Torben G.

3317,," We examine retail and wholesale prices for a large supermarket chain over seven and one-half years. We find that prices fall on average during seasonal demand peaks for a product, largely due to changes in retail margins. Retail margins for specific goods fall during peak demand periods for that good, even if these periods do not coincide with aggregate demand peaks for the retailer. This is consistent with ""loss-leader"" models of retailer competition. Models stressing cyclical demand elasticities or cyclical firm conduct are less consistent with our findings. Manufacturer behavior plays a limited role in the countercyclicality of prices.","Chevalier, Judith A. Kashyap, Anil K.

We examine the impact of public information in a setting where agents take actions appropriate to the underlying fundamentals, but they also have a coordination motive arising from a strategic complementarity in their actions. When the agents have no socially valuable private information, greater provision of public information always increases welfare. However, when agents also have access to independent sources of information, the welfare effect of increased public disclosures is ambiguous.","Morris, Stephen Shin, Hyun Song",10.1257/000282802762024610,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282802762024610,2002/12,Social Value of Public Information,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282802762024610,2002.0,1796

The analysis shows that when an airport is dominated by a monopolist, congestion is fully internalized, yielding no role for congestion pricing under monopoly conditions. Under a Cournot oligopoly, however, carriers are shown to internalize only the congestion they impose on themselves. A toll that captures the uninternalized portion of congestion may then improve the allocation of traffic.

When the economy is mainly subject to shocks that do not involve monetary policy trade-offs for society, inflation targeting is preferable. Otherwise, nominal income growth targeting may be superior because it induces inertial policy making, which improves the inflation-output-gap trade-off. Somewhat paradoxically, inflation targeting may be relatively less favorable the more society dislikes inflation, and the more persistent are the effects of inflation-generating shocks.

A significant fraction of employees behave as the ""rational cheater model"" predicts. A substantial proportion of employees, however, do not respond to manipulations in the monitoring rate.

Using Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data on protected-worker discrimination complaints and labor-market data from the Current Population Survey, we examine how returns to experience among protected workers changed around the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. We show that employers' reactions to employment protections may induce redistributive effects. Furthermore, these effects operate not merely across groups of differing protected status, but also within groups of identical protected status.

3998,," During the 1980's, theories were developed to explain the striking correlation between real exchange rates and foreign direct investment (FDI). However, this relationship broke down for Japanese FDI in the 1990's, as the real exchange rate appreciated while FDI plummeted. We propose the relative access to credit hypothesis and show that unequal access to credit by Japanese firms contributes to the explanation of declining Japanese FDI. Using bank-level and firm-level data sets, we find that financial difficulties at banks were economically and statistically important in reducing the number of FDI projects by Japanese firms into the United States.

3999,," This paper shows how competition generates reputation-building behavior in repeated interactions when the product quality observed by consumers is a noisy signal of firms' effort level. There are two types of firms and ""good"" firms try to distinguish themselves from ""bad"" firms. Although consumers get convinced that firms which are repeatedly successful in providing high quality are good firms, competition endogenously generates the outside option inducing disappointed consumers to leave firms. This threat of exit induces good firms to choose high effort, allowing good reputations to be valuable, but its uncompromising execution forces good firms out of the market.

We report a series of first-price auction experiments to measure the degree of inefficiency that occurs with financially motivated bidders. While some subjects fall prey to the winner's curse, they weigh their private and common value information in roughly the same manner as rational bidders, with observed efficiencies close to predicted levels. Increased competition and reduced uncertainty about the common value positively affect revenues and efficiency. The public release of information about the common value also raises efficiency, although less than predicted. (JEL C72, D44)","Goeree K.

4001,," We investigate the ability of expected utility theory to account for simultaneous gambling and insurance. Contrary to a previous claim that borrowing and lending in perfect capital markets removes the demand for gambles, we show expected utility theory with nonconcave utility functions can explain gambling. When the rates of interest and time preference are equal, agents seek to gamble unless income falls in a finite set of values. When they differ, there is a range of incomes where gambles are desired. Different borrowing and lending rates can account for persistent gambling provided the rates span the rate of time preference.

Using an empirical framework derived from the consumption insurance literature and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics we examine the effect of federal income tax reforms of the 1980's on automatic stabilization of consumption. Overall, ERTA and TRA86 reduced consumption stability by about 50 percent. Recently increased EITC generosity restored or enhanced consumption insurance. The welfare cost of moving to the post-TRA86 system is sizable for relatively risk-averse households facing large income risk but is much more modest for the typical household.

We find a sizeable negative effect of public spending—and in particular of its wage component—on profits and on business investment. This result is consistent with different theoretical models in which government employment creates wage pressure for the private sector. Various types of taxes also have negative effects on profits, but, interestingly, the effects of government spending on investment are larger than those of taxes.

The world production frontier is constructed using deterministic methods requiring no specification of functional form for the technology nor any assumption about market structure or the absence of market imperfections. We analyze the evolution of the cross-country distribution of labor productivity in terms of the tripartite decomposition, finding that technological change is decidedly nonneutral and that both growth and bipolar international divergence are driven primarily by capital deepening.

While the dual estimates of TFPG for Korea and Hong Kong are similar to the primal estimates, they exceed the primal estimates by 1 percent a year for Taiwan and by more than 2 percent for Singapore. The reason for the large discrepancy for Singapore is because the return to capital has remained constant, despite the high rate of capital accumulation indicated by Singapore's national accounts. This discrepancy is not explained by financial market controls, capital income taxes, risk premium changes, and public investment subsidies.

4124,," We analyze politically motivated privatization in a bipartisan environment. When median-class voters a priori favor redistributive policies, a strategic privatization program allocating them enough shares can induce a voting shift away from left-wing parties whose policy would reduce the value of shareholdings. To induce median-class voters to buy enough shares to shift political preferences, strategic rationing and underpricing is often necessary. In the extreme, this may lead to free share distribution and voucher privatization. Shifting voting preferences becomes impossible when strong ex ante political constraints require large upfront transfers to insiders or when social inequality is extreme.

In the model, long-run growth arises from the worldwide discovery of ideas, which depends on population growth. Nevertheless, constant growth can temporarily proceed at a faster rate, provided research intensity and educational attainment rise steadily over time. Growth accounting reveals that these factors explain 80 percent of recent U.S. growth, with less than 20 percent coming from world population growth.

For countries below 40 percent of U.S. output per worker, less than half of the output gap relative to the United States is attributed to human and physical capital.

New products are developed in diversified cities, trying processes borrowed from different activities.

The initially disenfranchised poor can contest power by threatening revolution, especially when the opportunity cost is low, for example, during recessions. The threat of revolution may force the elite to democratize. Democracy may not consolidate because it is redistributive, and so gives the elite an incentive to mount a coup. Highly unequal societies are less likely to consolidate democracy, and may end up oscillating between regimes and suffer substantial fiscal volatility.","Acemoglu, Daron Robinson, James A.",10.1257/aer.91.4.938,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.4.938,2001/09,A Theory of Political Transitions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.4.938,2001.0,2038

We develop a theoretical model to divide trade's impact on pollution into scale, technique, and composition effects and then examine this theory using data on sulfur dioxide concentrations. We find international trade creates relatively small changes in pollution concentrations when it alters the composition of national output. Estimates of the trade-induced technique and scale effects imply a net reduction in pollution from these sources.

In contrast, a constant returns model with national product differentiation predicts a less than proportionate increase.

Life-cycle models attribute this variation to differences in time preference rates, risk tolerance, exposure to uncertainty, relative tastes for work and leisure at advanced ages, and income replacement rates. These factors have testable implications concerning the relation between accumulated wealth and the shape of the consumption profile. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we find little support for these implications.

This paper tests whether rents fostered by regulation were shared with labor, and whether firms were discriminating by sharing these rents disproportionately with male workers. We find that average compensation and average wages for banking employees fell after states deregulated. Male wages fell by about 12 percent after deregulation, whereas women's wages fell by only 3 percent, suggesting that rents were shared mainly with men. Women's share of employment in managerial positions also increased following deregulation.","Black, Sandra E.

4203,Q15 Z13 J43 L14," Survey data suggest that cropsharing contracts exhibit a much higher degree of uniformity than is warranted by economic fundamentals. We propose a dynamic model of contract choice to explain this phenomenon. Landowners and tenants recontract periodically, taking into account expected returns as well as conformity with local practice. The resulting stochastic dynamical system is studied using techniques from statistical mechanics. The most likely states consist of patches where contractual terms are nearly uniform, separated by boundaries where the terms shift abruptly. These and other predictions of the model are borne out by survey data on agricultural contracts in Illinois.","Young, H.

4204,D82 D44 D72," We study a contest with multiple, nonidentical prizes. Participants are privately informed about a parameter (ability) affecting their costs of effort. The contestant with the highest effort wins the first prize, the contestant with the second-highest effort wins the second prize, and so on until all the prizes are allocated. The contest's designer maximizes expected effort. When cost functions are linear or concave in effort, it is optimal to allocate the entire prize sum to a single ""first"" prize. When cost functions are convex, several positive prizes may be optimal.","Moldovanu, Benny Sela, Aner",10.1257/aer.91.3.542,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.542,2001/06,The Optimal Allocation of Prizes in Contests,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.542,2001.0,2063
4205,M54 D23 J33 J41," Much of the existing theory of incentives describes a static relationship that lasts for just one transaction. This static assumption is not only unrealistic, but the resulting predictions appear to be at odds with many work organizations. The current paper introduces possible long-term interaction among agents, and studies how the design of explicit incentives and work organizations can exploit, and interact with, the implicit incentives generated by the repeated interaction of the agents. The optimal incentive scheme is shown to display observed features of the increasingly popular ""teams,"" such as the use of low-powered, group incentives.","Che, Yeon-Koo Yoo, Seung-Weon",10.1257/aer.91.3.525,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.525,2001/06,Optimal Incentives for Teams,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.525,2001.0,2064
4206,D83 D81," Suppose that agents share risks in competitive markets. We show that better information makes everyone worse off if the economy has a representative agent--that is, the economy's demand for state-contingent consumption equals the demand of a hypothetical agent who owns all the economy's wealth. The representative agent, moreover, is normatively unrepresentative: although each agent dislikes information, the ""representative"" agent is indifferent. Although we emphasize pure exchange, our results imply that a representative-agent model might seriously misstate the welfare effects of improved information in an economy with production and risk sharing, even if it performs well otherwise.","Schlee, Edward E.",10.1257/aer.91.3.509,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.509,2001/06,The Value of Information in Efficient Risk-Sharing Arrangements,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.509,2001.0,2065
4207,D40 L10," This paper introduces a new model of exchange: networks, rather than markets, of buyers and sellers. It begins with the empirically motivated premise that a buyer and seller must have a relationship, a ""link,"" to exchange goods. Networks--buyers, sellers, and the pattern of links connecting them--are common exchange environments. This paper develops a methodology to study network structures and explains why agents may form networks. In a model that captures characteristics of a variety of industries, the paper shows that buyers and sellers, acting strategically in their own self-interests, can form the network structures that maximize overall welfare.","Kranton, Rachel E.

4208,D83 C72," An evolutionary game model shows how an equilibrium distribution of competence may evolve when members of a population prey on one another, but when predatory competence is costly to acquire. Under one interpretation, the competence distribution is an endogenously determined distribution of bounded rationality. An example shows how ""tricksters"" and ""suckers"" might coexist in the long run. The analysis leads to a curious result about a mixed equilibrium for a symmetric, zero-sum game. An increase in the costs of one or more competence levels has exactly zero effect on the fraction of the population at those levels.","Conlisk, John",10.1257/aer.91.3.475,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.475,2001/06,Costly Predation and the Distribution of Competence,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.475,2001.0,2067
4209,L11 L86 D83," We examine the equilibrium interaction between a market for price information (controlled by a gatekeeper) and the homogenous product market it serves. The gatekeeper charges fees to firms that advertise prices on its Internet site and to consumers who access the list of advertised prices. Gatekeeper profits are maximized in an equilibrium where (a) the product market exhibits price dispersion; (b) access fees are sufficiently low that all consumers subscribe; (c) advertising fees exceed socially optimal levels, thus inducing partial firm participation; and (d) advertised prices are below unadvertised prices. Introducing the market for information has ambiguous social welfare effects.","Baye, Michael R.

4210,L82 L22," I examine the effects of vertical integration between programming and distribution in the cable television industry. I assess the effects of ownership structure on program offerings, prices, and subscriptions, and I compare consumer welfare across integrated and unintegrated markets. The results of this analysis suggest two general conclusions. First, integrated operators tend to exclude rival program services, suggesting that certain program services cannot gain access to the distribution networks of vertically integrated cable system operators. Second, vertical integration does not harm, and may actually benefit, consumers because of the associated efficiency gains.","Chipty, Tasneem",10.1257/aer.91.3.428,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.428,2001/06,"Vertical Integration, Market Foreclosure, and Consumer Welfare in the Cable Television Industry",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.428,2001.0,2069
4211,D44 Q23," When bidders anticipate an opportunity for resale trade, the value of winning an auction is determined in part by the option values of buying and selling in the secondary market. One implication is that a bidder's willingness to pay at an auction increases with the expected level of competition between resale buyers. Empirical evidence from auctions of timber contracts supports this prediction and rejects standard models that ignore resale. The estimated effect is smaller after policy changes expected to diminish the prevalence of resale. Additional evidence supports the predicted presence of a common value element introduced by the resale opportunity.","Haile, Philip A.",10.1257/aer.91.3.399,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.399,2001/06,Auctions with Resale Markets: An Application to U.S. Forest Service Timber Sales,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.399,2001.0,2070
4212,L13 L12 L41 N72," Detailed notes on weekly meetings of the sugar-refining cartel show how communication helps firms collude, and so highlight the deficiencies in the current formal theory of collusion. The Sugar Institute did not fix prices or output. Prices were increased by homogenizing business practices to make price cutting more transparent. Meetings were used to interpret and adapt the agreement, coordinate on jointly profitable actions, ensure unilateral actions were not misconstrued as cheating, and determine whether cheating had occurred. In contrast to established theories, cheating did occur, but sparked only limited retaliation, partly due to the contractual relations with selling agents.","Genesove, David Mullin, Wallace P.",10.1257/aer.91.3.379,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.3.379,2001/06,"Rules, Communication, and Collusion: Narrative Evidence from the Sugar Institute Case",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.3.379,2001.0,2071

4320,H43 D61," By incorporating the probability distribution directly into the analysis, this paper proposes a new theoretical approach to resolving the perennial dilemma of being uncertain about what discount rate to use in cost-benefit analysis. A numerical example is constructed from the results of a survey based on the opinions of 2,160 economists. The main finding is that even if every individual believes in a constant discount rate, the wide spread of opinion on what it should be makes the effective social discount rate decline significantly over time. Implications and ramifications of this proposed ""gamma-discounting"" approach are discussed.","Weitzman, Martin L.",10.1257/aer.91.1.260,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.260,2001/03,Gamma Discounting,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.260,2001.0,2179
4321,O34 O31 O38," Proponents of the Bayh-Dole Act argue that industrial use of federally funded research would be reduced without university patent licensing. Our survey of U.S. universities supports this view, emphasizing the embryonic state of most technologies licensed and the need for inventor cooperation in commercialization. Thus, for most university inventions, there is a moral-hazard problem with inventor effort. For such inventions, development does not occur unless the inventor's income is tied to the licensee's output by payments such as royalties or equity. Sponsored research from the licensee cannot by itself solve this problem.","Jensen, Richard Thursby, Marie",10.1257/aer.91.1.240,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.240,2001/03,Proofs and Prototypes for Sale: The Licensing of University Inventions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.240,2001.0,2180
4322,D72 H41, Politicians who care about the spoils of office may underprovide a public good because its benefits cannot be targeted to voters as easily as pork-barrel spending. We compare a winner-take-all system--where all the spoils go to the winner--to a proportional system--where the spoils of office are split among candidates proportionally to their share of the vote. In a winner-take-all system the public good is provided less often than in a proportional system when the public good is particularly desirable. We then consider the electoral college system and show that it is particularly subject to this inefficiency.,"Lizzeri, Alessandro Persico, Nicola",10.1257/aer.91.1.225,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.225,2001/03,The Provision of Public Goods under Alternative Electoral Incentives,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.225,2001.0,2181

Eventually, players with a long string of bad experiences become inactive. This prospect can cause a coordination avalanche in which all activity in the population stops. Coordination avalanches are part of Pareto-efficient equilibria; they can occur at any point in the game; their occurrence does not depend on the true state of nature; and allowing players to exchange information may merely hasten their onset. We present applications to search markets, organizational meltdown, and inefficient computer upgrades.","Jeitschko, Thomas D.

4324,E24 J64," Behind similar unemployment rates in the United States and Portugal hide two very different labor markets. Unemployment duration is three times longer in Portugal than in the United States. Symmetrically, flows of workers into unemployment are three times lower in Portugal. These lower flows come in roughly equal proportions from lower job creation and destruction, and from lower worker flows given job creation and destruction. A plausible explanation is high employment protection in Portugal. High employment protection makes economies more sclerotic; but because it affects unemployment duration and worker flows in opposite directions, the effect on unemployment is ambiguous.","Blanchard, Olivier Portugal, Pedro",10.1257/aer.91.1.187,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.187,2001/03,What Hides Behind an Unemployment Rate: Comparing Portuguese and U.S. Labor Markets,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.187,2001.0,2183
4325,E52 E31 E63," This paper characterizes conditions under which interest-rate feedback rules that set the nominal interest rate as an increasing function of the inflation rate induce aggregate instability by generating multiple equilibria. It shows that these conditions depend not only on the monetary-fiscal regime (as emphasized in the fiscal theory of the price level) but also on the way in which money is assumed to enter preferences and technology. It provides a number of examples in which, contrary to what is commonly believed, active monetary policy gives rise to multiple equilibria and passive monetary policy renders the equilibrium unique.","Benhabib, Jess Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie Uribe, Martin",10.1257/aer.91.1.167,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.167,2001/03,Monetary Policy and Multiple Equilibria,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.167,2001.0,2184
4326,E32 E44 O41," Two modifications are introduced into the standard real-business-cycle model: habit preferences and a two-sector technology with limited intersectoral factor mobility. The model is consistent with the observed mean risk-free rate, equity premium, and Sharpe ratio on equity. In addition, its business-cycle implications represent a substantial improvement over the standard model. It accounts for persistence in output, comovement of employment across different sectors over the business cycle, the evidence of ""excess sensitivity"" of consumption growth to output growth, and the ""inverted leading-indicator property of interest rates,"" that interest rates are negatively correlated with future output.","Boldrin, Michele Christiano, Lawrence J.

4327,H55 D91," With fixed costs of participating in the stock market, consumers with high income will participate in the stock market, but consumers with lower income will not participate. If a fully funded defined-contribution Social Security system tries to exploit the equity premium by selling a dollar of bonds per capita and buying a dollar of equity per capita, consumers who save but do not participate in the stock market will increase their consumption, thereby reducing saving and capital accumulation. Calibration of a general-equilibrium model indicates that this policy could reduce the aggregate capital stock substantially, by about 50 cents per capita.","Abel, Andrew B.",10.1257/aer.91.1.128,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.128,2001/03,The Effects of Investing Social Security Funds in the Stock Market When Fixed Costs Prevent Some Households from Holding Stocks,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.128,2001.0,2186
4328,D91 G11," According to conventional wisdom, long-term bonds are appropriate for conservative long-term investors. This paper develops a model of optimal consumption and portfolio choice for infinite-lived investors with recursive utility who face stochastic interest rates, solves the model using an approximate analytical method, and evaluates conventional wisdom. As risk aversion increases, the myopic component of risky asset demand disappears but the intertemporal hedging component does not. Conservative investors hold assets to hedge the risk that real interest rates will decline. Long-term inflation-indexed bonds are most suitable for this purpose, but nominal bonds may also be used if inflation risk is low.","Campbell, John Y.

4329,G11 G23 H55," There is a worldwide trend toward defined contribution saving plans and growing interest in privatized Social Security plans. In both environments, individuals are given some responsibility to make their own asset-allocation decisions, raising concerns about how well they do at this task. This paper investigates one aspect of the task, namely diversification. We show that some investors follow the ""1/n strategy"": they divide their contributions evenly across the funds offered in the plan. Consistent with this naive notion of diversification, we find that the proportion invested in stocks depends strongly on the proportion of stock funds in the plan.","Benartzi, Shlomo Thaler, Richard H.",10.1257/aer.91.1.79,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.91.1.79,2001/03,Naive Diversification Strategies in Defined Contribution Saving Plans,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.1.79,2001.0,2188
4330,G34 G35 O16," Whereas most U.S. corporations are widely held, the predominant form of ownership in East Asia is control by a family, which often supplies a top manager. These features of ""crony capitalism"" are actually more pronounced in Western Europe. In both regions, the salient agency problem is expropriation of outside shareholders by controlling shareholders. Dividends provide evidence on this. Group-affiliated corporations in Europe pay higher dividends than in Asia, dampening insider expropriation. Dividend rates are higher in Europe, but lower in Asia, when there are multiple large shareholders, suggesting that they dampen expropriation in Europe, but exacerbate it in Asia.","Faccio, Mara Lang, Larry H.

Despite break-even discount rates exceeding 17 percent, most of the separatees selected the lump sum--saving taxpayers $1.7 billion in separation costs.

4735,," Using a new international dataset of trade-weighed exchange rates, this paper highlights a neglected adjustment mechanism in the classical gold standard literature. Since gold-pegged countries traded extensively with economies operating more flexible monetary regimes and where parity change was a common adjustment device to systemic shocks, we show that such parity adjustments induced worldwide swings in nominal effective exchange rates. These translated into real exchange rate variations to which trade balances responded with an average elasticity of unity and in the direction of restoring external disequilibria. We conclude that some nominal exchange rate flexibility thus present in the pre-1914 system was instrumental to international payments adjustment.","Catão, Luis A. V.

This paper introduces a new dataset of close to fifteen thousand innovations at the Crystal Palace World's Fair in 1851 and at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 to examine the effects of patent laws on the direction of innovation. The paper tests the following argument: if innovative activity is motivated by expected profits, and if the effectiveness of patent protection varies across industries, then innovation in countries without patent laws should focus on industries where alternative mechanisms to protect intellectual property are effective. Analyses of exhibition data for 12 countries in 1851 and 10 countries in 1876 indicate that inventors in countries without patent laws focused on a small set of industries where patents were less important, while innovation in countries with patent laws appears to be much more diversified. These findings suggest that patents help to determine the direction of technical change and that the adoption of patent laws in countries without such laws may alter existing patterns of comparative advantage across countries.","Moser, Petra",10.1257/0002828054825501,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054825501,2005/09,How Do Patent Laws Influence Innovation?

This paper studies utility-based biases in beliefs by supposing that beliefs maximize average felicity, optimally balancing this benefit of optimism against the costs of worse decision making. A small optimistic bias in beliefs typically leads to first-order gains in anticipatory utility and only second-order costs in realized outcomes. In a portfolio choice example, investors overestimate their return and exhibit a preference for skewness; in general equilibrium, investors' prior beliefs are endogenously heterogeneous.

A firm committed to openness incurs higher liability and R&D costs, though product demand is not diminished.

On topics where reader beliefs diverge (such as politically divisive issues), however, newspapers segment the market and slant toward extreme positions.

Unlike analyses derived from cooperative game theory, we find that each voter's expected payoff is proportional to her voting weight. An exception occurs when many high-weight voters exist, as low-weight voters may expect disproportionately high payoffs due to proposal power. The model also predicts that, ex post, the coalition formateur (the party chosen to form a coalition) will receive a disproportionately high payoff.

4748,," Different beliefs about the fairness of social competition and what determines income inequality influence the redistributive policy chosen in a society. But the composition of income in equilibrium depends on tax policies. We show how the interaction between social beliefs and welfare policies may lead to multiple equilibria or multiple steady states. If a society believes that individual effort determines income, and that all have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, it will choose low redistribution and low taxes. In equilibrium, effort will be high and the role of luck will be limited, in which case market outcomes will be relatively fair and social beliefs will be self-fulfilled. If, instead, a society believes that luck, birth, connections, and/or corruption determine wealth, it will levy high taxes, thus distorting allocations and making these beliefs self-sustained as well. These insights may help explain the cross-country variation in perceptions about income inequality and choices of redistributive policies.","Alesina, Alberto Angeletos, George-Marios",10.1257/0002828054825655,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054825655,2005/09,Fairness and Redistribution,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054825655,2005.0,2253

4761,," This paper shows that price rigidity evolves in an economy populated by imperfectly rational agents who experiment with alternative rules of thumb. In the model, firms must set their prices in face of aggregate demand shocks. Their payoff depends on the level of aggregate demand, as well as on their own price and their ""neighbor's"" price. The latter assumption captures local interactions. Despite the fact that the rational expectations equilibrium (REE) is characterized by a simple pricing rule that firms can easily adopt, the economy does not converge to the REE for all parameter values. When the volatility of monetary innovations is low and interactions among firms are high, the aggregate price level exhibits rigidity, in that it does not fully react to contemporaneous aggregate demand shocks. We discuss the role of the nature of experimentation, and of path dependence driven by interactions, in explaining these results.","Saint-Paul, Gilles",10.1257/0002828054201251,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201251,2005/06,Some Evolutionary Foundations for Price Level Rigidity,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201251,2005.0,2266

Structural estimation supports two key model features: collateral effects dramatically improve the response of aggregate demand to housing price shocks; and nominal debt improves the sluggish response of output to inflation surprises. Finally, policy evaluation considers the role of house prices and debt indexation in affecting monetary policy trade-offs.","Iacoviello, Matteo",10.1257/0002828054201477,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201477,2005/06,"House Prices, Borrowing Constraints, and Monetary Policy in the Business Cycle",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201477,2005.0,2267
4763,," We study good-by-good deviations from the Law-of-One-Price (LOP) for over 1,800 retail goods and services between all European Union (EU) countries for the years 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990. We find that for each of these years, after we control for differences in income and value-added tax (VAT) rates, there are roughly as many overpriced goods as there are underpriced goods between any two EU countries. We also find that good-by-good measures of cross-sectional price dispersion are negatively related to the tradeability of the good, and positively related to the share of non-traded inputs required to produce the good. We argue that these observations are consistent with a model in which retail goods are produced by combining a traded input with a non-traded input.","Crucini, Mario J. Telmer, Chris I.

4764,," Large economies export more in absolute terms than do small economies. We use data on shipments by 126 exporting countries to 59 importing countries in 5,000 product categories to answer the question: How? Do big economies export larger quantities of each good (the intensive margin), a wider set of goods (the extensive margin), or higher-quality goods? We find that the extensive margin accounts for around 60 percent of the greater exports of larger economies. Within categories, richer countries export higher quantities at modestly higher prices. We compare these findings to some workhorse trade models. Models with Armington national product differentiation have no extensive margin, and incorrectly predict lower prices for the exports of larger economies. Models with Krugman firm-level product differentiation do feature a prominent extensive margin, but overpredict the rate at which variety responds to exporter size. Models with quality differentiation, meanwhile, can match the price facts. Finally, models with fixed costs of exporting to a given market might explain the tendency of larger economies to export a given product to more countries.","Hummels, David Klenow, Peter J.",10.1257/0002828054201396,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201396,2005/06,The Variety and Quality of a Nation's Exports,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201396,2005.0,2269

The optimal contract is nonstationary and has infinite memory, but is described by a simple state variable. Under general conditions, supply converges to the efficient level for any degree of persistence of the types and along any history, though convergence is history-dependent. In contrast, as with constant types, the optimal contract can be renegotiation-proof, even with highly persistent types.

4768,," A unifying theme in the literature on organizations such as public bureaucracies and private nonprofits is the importance of mission, as opposed to profit, as an organizational goal. Such mission-oriented organizations are frequently staffed by motivated agents who subscribe to the mission. This paper studies incentives in such contexts and emphasizes the role of matching the mission preferences of principals and agents in increasing organizational efficiency. Matching economizes on the need for high-powered incentives. It can also, however, entrench bureaucratic conservatism and resistance to innovations. The framework developed in this paper is applied to school competition, incentives in the public sector and in private nonprofits, and the interdependence of incentives and productivity between the private for-profit sector and the mission-oriented sector through occupational choice.","Besley, Timothy Ghatak, Maitreesh",10.1257/0002828054201413,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201413,2005/06,Competition and Incentives with Motivated Agents,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201413,2005.0,2273

Policy uniformity reduces the size of the union, may block the entry of new members, and induces excessive centralization.

The model generates a pattern of changes similar to the demographic transition, where gains in life expectancy at birth are followed by reductions in fertility and increases in the rate of human capital accumulation. The onset of the transition is characterized by a critical level of life expectancy at birth, which marks the movement of the economy from a Malthusian equilibrium to an equilibrium with investments in human capital and the possibility of long-run growth.","Soares, Rodrigo R.",10.1257/0002828054201486,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201486,2005/06,"Mortality Reductions, Educational Attainment, and Fertility Choice",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201486,2005.0,2275
4771,," The rise of Western Europe after 1500 is due largely to growth in countries with access to the Atlantic Ocean and with substantial trade with the New World, Africa, and Asia via the Atlantic. This trade and the associated colonialism affected Europe not only directly, but also indirectly by inducing institutional change. Where ""initial"" political institutions (those established before 1500) placed significant checks on the monarchy, the growth of Atlantic trade strengthened merchant groups by constraining the power of the monarchy, and helped merchants obtain changes in institutions to protect property rights. These changes were central to subsequent economic growth.","Acemoglu, Daron Johnson, Simon Robinson, James",10.1257/0002828054201305,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828054201305,2005/06,"The Rise of Europe: Atlantic Trade, Institutional Change, and Economic Growth",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828054201305,2005.0,2276
4772,," We conduct experiments to explore the possibility that subject misconceptions, as opposed to a particular theory of preferences referred to as the ""endowment effect,"" account for reported gaps between willingness to pay (""WTP"") and willingness to accept (""WTA""). The literature reveals two important facts. First, there is no consensus regarding the nature or robustness of WTP-WTA gaps. Second, while experimenters are careful to control for subject misconceptions, there is no consensus about the fundamental properties of misconceptions or how to avoid them. Instead, by implementing different types of experimental controls, experimenters have revealed notions of how misconceptions arise. Experimenters have applied these controls separately or in different combinations. Such controls include ensuring subject anonymity, using incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms, and providing subjects with practice and training on the elicitation mechanism before employing it to measure valuations. The pattern of results reported in the literature suggests that the widely differing reports of WTP-WTA gaps could be due to an incomplete science regarding subject misconceptions. We implement a ""revealed theory"" methodology to compensate for the lack of a theory of misconceptions. Theories implicit in experimental procedures found in the literature are at the heart of our experimental design. Thus, our approach to addressing subject misconceptions reflects an attempt to control simultaneously for all dimensions of concern over possible subject misconceptions found in the literature. To this end, our procedures modify the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism used in previous studies to elicit values. In addition, our procedures supplement commonly used procedures by providing extensive training on the elicitation mechanism before subjects provide WTP and WTA responses. Experiments were conducted using both lotteries and mugs, goods frequently used in endowment effect experiments. Using the modified procedures, we observe no gap between WTA and WTP. Therefore, our results call into question the interpretation of observed gaps as evidence of loss aversion or prospect theory. Further evidence is required before convincing interpretations of observed gaps can be advanced.","Plott, Charles R.

4885,," This paper studies how to protect future generations from expropriation and to induce optimal investment in intergenerational public goods (IPGs), by introducing constitutional restrictions on the tax base. The type of tax-base restrictions that we consider places limits on the tax instruments that the government can use to raise revenue, but not on the level of expenditures or debt. We show that the introduction of a constitutional amendment requiring that IPGs and debt be financed with land taxes makes intergenerational expropriation impossible and, for many cases of interest, induces optimal investment in IPGs. We also show that a weaker constitutional amendment requiring that IPGs be financed with land taxes, but imposing no restrictions on how to finance the debt, has a positive impact on IPGs, but not on expropriation. The paper also studies the political feasibility of these reforms. We show that the first reform is not politically feasible since it hurts current generations, but the weaker reform can induce a Pareto improvement.","Rangel, Antonio",10.1257/0002828053828527,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828527,2005/03,How to Protect Future Generations Using Tax-Base Restrictions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828527,2005.0,2390
4886,," Transport time increases with distance traveled, and time is valuable. We show the implications of these facts for global specialization and trade: products where timely delivery is important will be produced near the source of final demand, where wages will be higher as a result. In the model, timely delivery is important because it allows retailers to respond to final demand fluctuations without holding costly inventories, and timely delivery is possible only from nearby locations. Using a unique dataset that allows us to measure the retail demand for timely delivery, we show that the sources of U.S. apparel imports have shifted in the way predicted by the model, with products for which timeliness matters increasingly imported from nearby countries.","Evans, Carolyn L.

4888,," GDP per capita is usually used to proxy for the quality of life of individuals living in different countries. Welfare is also affected by quantity of life, however, as represented by longevity. This paper incorporates longevity into an overall assessment of the evolution of cross-country inequality and shows that it is quantitatively important. The absence of reduction in cross-country inequality up to the 1990s documented in previous work is in stark contrast to the reduction in inequality after incorporating gains in longevity. Throughout the post–World War II period, health contributed to reduce significantly welfare inequality across countries. This paper derives valuation formulas for infra-marginal changes in longevity and computes a ""full"" growth rate that incorporates the gains in health experienced by 96 countries for the period between 1960 and 2000. Incorporating longevity gains changes traditional results; countries starting with lower income tended to grow faster than countries starting with higher income. We estimate an average yearly growth in ""full income"" of 4.1 percent for the poorest 50 percent of countries in 1960, of which 1.7 percentage points are due to health, as opposed to a growth of 2.6 percent for the richest 50 percent of countries, of which only 0.4 percentage points are due to health. Additionally, we decompose changes in life expectancy into changes attributable to 13 broad groups of causes of death and three age groups. We show that mortality from infectious, respiratory, and digestive diseases, congenital, perinatal, and ""ill-defined"" conditions, mostly concentrated before age 20 and between ages 20 and 50, is responsible for most of the reduction in life expectancy inequality. At the same time, the recent effect of AIDS, together with reductions in mortality after age 50—due to nervous system, senses organs, heart and circulatory diseases—contributed to increase health inequality across countries.","Becker, Gary S.

4889,," Relative purchasing power parity (PPP) holds for pure price inflations, which affect prices of all goods and services by the same proportion, while leaving relative prices unchanged. Pure price inflations also affect nominal returns of all traded financial assets by exactly the same amount. Recognizing that relative PPP may not hold for the official inflation data constructed from commodity price indices because of relative price changes and other frictions that cause prices to be ""sticky,"" we provide a novel method for extracting a proxy for realized pure price inflation from stock returns.

4890,," This paper shows that a country's wealth can be an important determinant of comparative advantage when access to credit differs across sectors of the economy. Wealthier nations exhibit a comparative advantage toward goods produced in sectors facing more severe financial imperfections. These sectors are typically populated by small firms. Empirically this paper documents that these sectors are also labor intensive. Consequently, this theory partially offsets traditional sources of comparative advantage and offers an explanation for Trefler's missing trade mystery and the Leontief paradox. Furthermore, the theory makes the relation between trade and income distribution endogenous.","Wynne, José",10.1257/0002828053828626,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828626,2005/03,Wealth as a Determinant of Comparative Advantage,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828626,2005.0,2395
4891,," This paper introduces methods to compute impulse responses without specification and estimation of the underlying multivariate dynamic system. The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages.","Jordà, Òscar",10.1257/0002828053828518,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828518,2005/03,Estimation and Inference of Impulse Responses by Local Projections,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828518,2005.0,2396

4895,," Prevalent thinking about liquidity traps suggests that the perfect substitutability of money and bonds at a zero short-term nominal interest rate renders open-market operations ineffective for achieving macroeconomic stabilization goals. We show that even were this the case, there remains a powerful argument for large-scale open market operations as a fiscal policy tool. As we also demonstrate, however, this same reasoning implies that open-market operations will be beneficial for stabilization as well, even when the economy is expected to remain mired in a liquidity trap for some time. Thus, the microeconomic fiscal benefits of open-market operations in a liquidity trap go hand in hand with standard macroeconomic objectives. Motivated by Japan's recent economic experience, we use a dynamic general-equilibrium model to assess the welfare impact of open-market operations for an economy in Japan's predicament. We argue Japan can achieve a substantial welfare improvement through large open-market purchases of domestic government debt.","Auerbach, Alan J.

In the United States, the standard deviation of the vacancy-unemployment ratio is almost 20 times as large as the standard deviation of average labor productivity, while the search model predicts that the two variables should have nearly the same volatility. A shock that changes average labor productivity primarily alters the present value of wages, generating only a small movement along a downward-sloping Beveridge curve (unemployment-vacancy locus). A shock to the separation rate generates a counterfactually positive correlation between unemployment and vacancies.

4900,," Following a recession, the aggregate labor market is slack–employment remains below normal and recruiting efforts of employers, as measured by help-wanted advertising and vacancies, are low. A model of matching friction explains the qualitative responses of the labor market to adverse shocks, but requires implausibly large shocks to account for the magnitude of observed fluctuations. The incorporation of wage stickiness vastly increases the sensitivity of the model to driving forces. I develop a new model of the way that wage stickiness affects unemployment. The stickiness arises in an economic equilibrium and satisfies the condition that no worker-employer pair has an unexploited opportunity for mutual improvement. Sticky wages neither interfere with the efficient formation of employment matches nor cause inefficient job loss. Thus the model provides an answer to the fundamental criticism previously directed at sticky-wage models of fluctuations.","Hall, Robert E.",10.1257/0002828053828482,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828053828482,2005/03,Employment Fluctuations with Equilibrium Wage Stickiness,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828053828482,2005.0,2405

For example, the fears induced by the possibility of failure or of negative evaluations have physiological consequences (shaking, loss of concentration) that may impair performance in sports, on stage, or at school. There is also ample evidence that individuals have distorted recollection of past events and distorted attributions of the causes of success or failure. Recollection of good events or successes is typically easier than recollection of bad ones or failures. Successes tend to be attributed to intrinsic aptitudes or effort, while failures are attributed to bad luck. In addition, these attributions are often reversed when judging the performance of others.

4918,," In this paper I suggest a unified explanation for two puzzles in the inventory literature: first, estimates of inventory speeds of adjustment in aggregate data are very small relative to the apparent rapid reaction of stocks to unanticipated variations in sales. Second, estimates of inventory speeds of adjustment in firm-level data are significantly higher than in aggregate data. The paper develops a multisector model where inventories are held to avoid stockouts, and price markups vary along the business cycle. The omission of countercyclical markup variations from inventory targets introduces a downward bias in estimates of adjustment speeds obtained from partial adjustment models. When the cyclicality of markups differs across sectors, this downward bias is shown to be more severe with aggregate rather than firm-level data.

The model, however, predicts that inventories will respond to long-run movements, that is, to regime shifts in the real interest rate. Tests emphasizing cointegration techniques confirm this prediction and show a significant long-run relationship between inventories and the real interest rate.","Maccini, Louis J.

4920,," We investigate the effect of scale on performance in the active money management industry. We first document that fund returns, both before and after fees and expenses, decline with lagged fund size, even after accounting for various performance benchmarks. We then explore a number of potential explanations for this relationship. This association is most pronounced among funds that have to invest in small and illiquid stocks, suggesting that these adverse scale effects are related to liquidity. Controlling for its size, a fund's return does not deteriorate with the size of the family that it belongs to, indicating that scale need not be bad for performance depending on how the fund is organized. Finally, using data on whether funds are solo-managed or team-managed and the composition of fund investments, we explore the idea that scale erodes fund performance because of the interaction of liquidity and organizational diseconomies.","Chen, Joseph Hong, Harrison Huang, Ming Kubik, Jeffrey D.",10.1257/0002828043052277,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828043052277,2004/12,Does Fund Size Erode Mutual Fund Performance?

We break the beta of a stock with the market portfolio into two components, one reflecting news about the market's future cash flows and one reflecting news about the market's discount rates. Intertemporal asset pricing theory suggests that the former should have a higher price of risk; thus beta, like cholesterol, comes in ""bad"" and ""good"" varieties. Empirically, we find that value stocks and small stocks have considerably higher cash-flow betas than growth stocks and large stocks, and this can explain their higher average returns. The poor performance of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) since 1963 is explained by the fact that growth stocks and high-past-beta stocks have predominantly good betas with low risk prices.","Campbell, John Y.

4954,," Independent courts render current policy more durable (by raising the cost of future policy changes) but may also engage in policy-making of their own. This paper asks: Is there an optimal level of judicial independence from the perspective of incumbent officials in the other branches? To answer that question, the paper develops a model of strategic institutional choice, and tests it on the judicial institutions of the American states. Consistent with the model's predictions, the most independenceenhancing institutions are found where political competition between rival parties is tightest and differences between party platforms are largest.","Hanssen, F.

4955,," The paper builds a tractable model of patent pools, agreements among patent owners to license sets of their patents. It provides a necessary and sufficient condition for patent pools to enhance welfare and shows that requiring pool members to be able to independently license patents matters if and only if the pool is otherwise welfare reducing. The paper allows patents to differ in importance, asymmetric blocking patterns, and licensors to also be licensees. We undertake some initial exploration of the impact of pools on innovation. The analysis has broader applicability than pools, being relevant to a number of co-marketing arrangements.","Lerner, Josh Tirole, Jean",10.1257/0002828041464641,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464641,2004/06,Efficient Patent Pools,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464641,2004.0,2460
4956,," I assess the magnitude of human capital spillovers by estimating production functions using a unique firm-worker matched data set. Productivity of plants in cities that experience large increases in the share of college graduates rises more than the productivity of similar plants in cities that experience small increases in the share of college graduates. These productivity gains are offset by increased labor costs. Using three alternative measures of economic distance—input-output flows, technological specialization, and patent citations—I find that within a city, spillovers between industries that are economically close are larger than spillovers between industries that are economically distant.","Moretti, Enrico",10.1257/0002828041464623,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464623,2004/06,"Workers' Education, Spillovers, and Productivity: Evidence from Plant-Level Production Functions",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464623,2004.0,2461
4957,," This paper argues that campaign finance policy, in the form of contribution limits and matching public financing, can be Pareto improving even under very optimistic assumptions concerning the role of campaign advertising and the rationality of voters. The optimistic assumptions are that candidates use campaign contributions to convey truthful information to voters about their qualifications for office and that voters update their beliefs rationally on the basis of the information they have seen. The argument also assumes that campaign contributions are provided by interest groups and that candidates can offer to provide policy favors to attract higher contributions.","Coate, Stephen",10.1257/0002828041464443,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464443,2004/06,Pareto-Improving Campaign Finance Policy,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464443,2004.0,2462
4958,," Many countries strive to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) hoping that knowledge brought by multinationals will spill over to domestic industries and increase their productivity. In contrast with earlier literature that failed to find positive intraindustry spillovers from FDI, this study focuses on effects operating across industries. The analysis, based on firm-level data from Lithuania, produces evidence consistent with positive productivity spillovers from FDI taking place through contacts between foreign affiliates and their local suppliers in upstream sectors. The data indicate that spillovers are associated with projects with shared domestic and foreign ownership but not with fully owned foreign investments.","Smarzynska Javorcik, Beata",10.1257/0002828041464605,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464605,2004/06,Does Foreign Direct Investment Increase the Productivity of Domestic Firms?

4959,," This paper investigates whether the housing market responds to the information incorporated in state-administered school grades. We study whether school grades affect families' residential locations and house prices. Using detailed data on repeated sales of individual residential properties in the state of Florida, we find evidence that there is an independent effect of these grades on house prices and residential location, above and beyond the estimated effects of test scores and the other components of the school grades. Because these grades have a large stochastic component, however, we find that over time the estimated effects of the grades has diminished.","Figlio, David N.

4960,," It is typically less profitable for an opportunistic borrower to divert inputs than to divert cash. Therefore, suppliers may lend more liberally than banks. This simple argument is at the core of our contract theoretic model of trade credit in competitive markets. The model implies that trade credit and bank credit can be either complements or substitutes. Among other things, the model explains why trade credit has short maturity, why trade credit is more prevalent in less developed credit markets, and why accounts payable of large unrated firms are more countercyclical than those of small firms.","Burkart, Mike Ellingsen, Tore",10.1257/0002828041464579,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464579,2004/06,In-Kind Finance: A Theory of Trade Credit,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464579,2004.0,2465
4961,," In the now-classical real options theory, the price of an underlying asset is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion, and optimal exercise strategies are described by simple explicit formulas. This paper extends the classical theory to allow any geometric Le´vy process to model prices. Such processes may account for fat tails and skewness of probability distributions of commodity prices. The optimal exercise strategies are specified in the paper in terms of statistics of record-setting low or high prices. The formulas derived extend those observed in the Gaussian case, but the form of the result is novel even for that case.","Boyarchenko, Svetlana",10.1257/0002828041464452,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464452,2004/06,Irreversible Decisions and Record-Setting News Principles,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464452,2004.0,2466
4962,," To identify the effect of social capital on financial development, we exploit social capital differences within Italy. In high-social-capital areas, households are more likely to use checks, invest less in cash and more in stock, have higher access to institutional credit, and make less use of informal credit. The effect of social capital is stronger where legal enforcement is weaker and among less educated people. These results are not driven by omitted environmental variables, since we show that the behavior of movers is still affected by the level of social capital of the province where they were born.","Guiso, Luigi Sapienza, Paola Zingales, Luigi",10.1257/0002828041464498,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464498,2004/06,The Role of Social Capital in Financial Development,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464498,2004.0,2467
4963,," This paper studies the matching of opportunities with talent when costly diagnosis confers an informational advantage to the agent undertaking it. When this agent is underqualified, adverse selection prevents efficient referrals through fixed-price contracts. Spot-market contracts that rely on income sharing can match opportunities with talent but induce a team-production problem which, if severe enough, can prevent the referral of valuable opportunities. Partnership contracts, in which agents agree in advance to the allocation of opportunities and of the revenues they generate, support referrals where the market cannot, but often at the expense of distortions on those opportunities that are not referred.","Garicano, Luis Santos, Tano",10.1257/0002828041464506,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464506,2004/06,Referrals,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464506,2004.0,2468

4965,," Governments can efficiently provide liquidity, as when the banking system is bailed out. We study a model in which not all assets can be used to purchase all other assets at every date. Agents sometimes want to sell projects. The market price of the projects sold depends on the supply of liquidity, which is determined in general equilibrium. While private liquidity provision is socially beneficial since it allows valuable reallocations, it is also socially costly since liquidity suppliers could have made more efficient investments ex ante. There is a role for the government to supply liquidity by issuing government securities.","Gorton, Gary Huang, Lixin",10.1257/0002828041464650,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464650,2004/06,"Liquidity, Efficiency, and Bank Bailouts",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464650,2004.0,2470

We show that employment is positively correlated across time and agents. Moreover, unemployment exhibits duration dependence: the probability of obtaining a job decreases in the length of time that an agent has been unemployed. Finally, we examine inequality between two groups. If staying in the labor market is costly and one group starts with a worse employment status, then that group's drop-out rate will be higher and their employment prospects will be persistently below that of the other group.","Calvó-Armengol, Antoni Jackson, Matthew O.",10.1257/0002828041464542,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0002828041464542,2004/06,The Effects of Social Networks on Employment and Inequality,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828041464542,2004.0,2471

5103,," This essay examines interconnections between ""race"" and economic inequality in the United States, focusing on the case of African-Americans. I will argue that it is crucially important to distinguish between racial discrimination and racial stigma in the study of this problem. Racial discrimination has to do with how blacks are treated, while racial stigma is concerned with how black people are perceived. My view is that what I call reward bias (unfair treatment of persons in formal economic transactions based on racial identity) is now a less significant barrier to the full participation by African-Americans in U.S. society than is what I will call development bias (blocked access to resources critical for personal development but available only via non-market-mediated social transactions). By making these points in the specific cultural and historical context of the black experience in U.S. society, I hope to contribute to a deeper conceptualization of the worldwide problem of race and economic marginality.","Loury, Glenn C.",10.1257/000282803321947308,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947308,2003/05,Racial Stigma: Toward a New Paradigm for Discrimination Theory,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947308,2003.0,2608

5114,," At least 41 million Americans are currently without health insurance in any given month (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2002). They are uninsured for a variety of reasons, and most people who lack coverage are affected by more than one reason. Two generalizations can be made, however. First, a majority simply cannot afford to purchase health insurance unless it is heavily subsidized. Most do not have access to employer-sponsored coverage and so must purchase any insurance in the non-group (individual) health-insurance market - a market where, as I explain below, insurance is typically twice as expensive as employer-group coverage if it is not denied outright. Since about two-thirds of the uninsured have incomes below $35,000, non-group health-insurance premiums often exceed 10 percent of their incomes. The second generalization is that, to an important extent, high premiums in the non-group market and denial of coverage reflect market failure due to asymmetric information. Insurers can never know as much as an individual does about his or her health, family history of health problems, and tendency to seek medical care. Because of this asymmetry, it is impossible for an insurer to set premiums that accurately reflect the non-random portion of health-care costs for different individuals. The non-group market is the only health-insurance option for people without employersponsored coverage. Tax-related subsidies as proposed by members of Congress and the Bush administration do not address the market-failure problems and so are unlikely to make insurance much more affordable. To increase access to health insurance, risk in the non-group market needs to be shifted to a broader population base. In what follows, I first describe the three distinct health-insurance markets in which people can obtain health insurance, and the special nature of competition among insurance companies in the non-group market. Then I make the case for government to act as reinsurer and assume the risk of extremely high-cost people. Efficiency in the non-group health-insurance market would be improved if the government reinsured the market. Equity also would be increased if the government acted as reinsurer because more uninsured people would have access to insurance. Finally, I describe precedents for this role for government in other markets, and why tax-related subsidies will not succeed in increasing health-insurance coverage unless the risks of extremely high costs are shifted to the government.","Swartz, Katherine",10.1257/000282803321947209,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947209,2003/05,Reinsuring Risk to Increase Access to Health Insurance,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947209,2003.0,2619
5115,," The persistently large number of uninsured, roughly 40 million per year since 1993, continues to elicit bipartisan policy interest. Coverage-expansion proposals without mandates, by far the most common since the defeat of the Clinton plan, must address risk-pooling realities in private markets. Insurers have strong financial incentives to segment risks and minimize pooling of heterogeneous risks, and narrow risk-pooling will diminish the adequacy of premium subsidies based on income alone, at least for higher-risk individuals. The current debate over flat tax credits and the non-group market is a case in point (Blumberg, 2001; Center for Studying Health System Change, 2002; Jack Hadley and James D. Reschovsky, 2002). We, along with nine other teams, were asked to develop a proposal that would expand coverage in a large and creative way (see Holahan et al., 2001). The proposal we developed would subsidize low-income individuals and families but also addresses the issue of inefficient and inequitable risk-pooling.","Holahan, John Nichols, Len M. Blumberg, Linda J. Shen, Yu-Chu",10.1257/000282803321947191,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947191,2003/05,A New Approach to Risk-Spreading via Coverage-Expansion Subsidies,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947191,2003.0,2620
5116,," After a small decline, the number of uninsured persons in the United States is on the rise again, at over 41 million (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2002). This increase is likely to spur efforts to cover the uninsured through legislative action. Given the failure of the most recent attempt at massive insurance expansions (David Cutler and Gruber, 2002), the likely approach is through incremental reforms. At the same time, there remains a fundamental conflict between the right and the left over the appropriate form that such incremental reforms should take. The left advocates additional expansions of the public-insurance safety net, for example, to parents of children already publicly insured. The right advocates subsidizing the purchase of private insurance through the tax code. In recent years, a number of analyses, both inside and outside of government, have studied the impact of these types of reforms (e.g., John Holahan et al., 1999; Gruber and Larry Levitt, 2000; Mark McClellan, 2000). These analyses have largely talked past each other, however, as there is little agreement on the ""right"" criteria on which to evaluate incremental reforms. Should we be concerned solely with the number of persons newly insured? What about the extent of displacement of other forms of insurance coverage, or ""crowdout""? And what about the types of uninsured covered; should we count equally a low-cost child who is newly insured and a high-cost older person? In this paper, I lay out the issues surrounding the criteria along which alternative approaches to reform can be evaluated. I then present microsimulation estimates of the impacts of three types of reforms: tax credits for individual purchase of nongroup insurance, expansions of public insurance to children and parents, and expansion of public insurance to all adults. I use the results from these simulations to contrast these reforms using the various criteria developed here.","Gruber, Jonathan",10.1257/000282803321947182,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947182,2003/05,Evaluating Alternative Approaches to Incremental Health-Insurance Expansion,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947182,2003.0,2621
5117,," Following the financial crises of the late 1990's an increasing number of emergingmarket countries have adopted a flexible exchange-rate regime and an inflation-targeting monetary-policy framework. This trend has generated a growing debate on the appropriate monetary-policy rule for ""financially fragile"" economies with thin and incomplete financial markets that are subject to highly volatile capital flows. Within this context, I examine the implications of alternative monetary-policy rules and the choice of instruments and targets in a small open economy with imperfect capital markets. I compare a benchmark efficient-markets model with a monetary-targeting regime and three different inflation-targeting rules: the Taylor rule, a CPI inflation-target rule, and a non-tradable inflation-target rule. Furthermore, I study how sensitive the results are to varying degrees of capital-market integration. In addressing this question of the ""second best"" policy, the paper resembles that of Michael Devereaux and Phillip Lane (2001), who study the role of financial accelerator effects on various monetary-policy rules. I adopt a small open-economy setup rather than a two-country framework. In contrast to most small open-economy models, however, this paper does not assume a zero current-account balance. Net foreign-asset holdings and capital flows affect real volatility through the interest-rate risk premium. Given the significant role the risk premium plays in the external borrowing costs for emerging markets, this channel may have important consequences for economic dynamics.","Tuladhar, Anita",10.1257/000282803321947173,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947173,2003/05,Monetary Policy Under Imperfect Capital Markets in a Small Open Economy,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947173,2003.0,2622

5119,," Global aging is prompting workers and taxpayers everywhere to recognize their vulnerability to the inherent uncertainty of unfunded social-security systems. This has generated an international wave of social-security reforms over the last two decades, prompting more than 20 countries to establish Individual Account (IA) plans. In the United States, the idea of Individual Accounts has attracted recent interest with the release of the Final Report of the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS): here, voluntary individual accounts were proposed as a key element of a reformed national old-age system (see Commission to Strengthen Social Security, 2001; John F. Cogan and Mitchell, 2003). Strengths of IA's include the fact that participants gain ownership in their accounts and diversify their pension investments; nevertheless, IA participants also must bear capital-market risk. Recent market volatility has reminded investors of the importance of capital-market fluctuations and their potential impact on retirement income. In response, some policymakers have suggested that ""guarantees"" be designed to help protect IA investments. Abroad, such guarantees have been adopted in several Latin American countries undergoing reform, and most recently, in Japan and Germany (Mitchell and Kent Smetters, 2003). Sensible public policy recommending the adoption of guarantees must identify their costs and who will pay for them. In this paper, we discuss how to evaluate such costs in the context of a social-security reform that includes IA's, along with ways to finance them.","Lachance, Marie-Eve Mitchell, Olivia S.",10.1257/000282803321947155,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947155,2003/05,Guaranteeing Individual Accounts,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947155,2003.0,2624

5126,," The Industrial Revolution is a topic of renewed interest for growth economists. After the first wave of ""new growth"" theory that addressed the causes of sustained increases in productivity, more attention has been given to an important additional stylized fact: that rapid growth itself is new in historical terms. A radical discontinuity separates thousands of years of by and large stagnant living standards from the industrial era. Increasingly in the last few years, models have attempted to capture these long-run dynamics to try to explain how the world changed from a state where growth was fleeting and limited to one where it has become permanent and decisive. At the same time, economic historians have re-evaluated changes in living standards during the British Industrial Revolution (the canonical case). The new picture that emerges has become increasingly consistent over the last decade, and it differs drastically from earlier descriptions. This paper briefly summarizes the two literatures, contrasts the results obtained, and makes suggestions for a new set of ""stylized facts"" that could usefully guide future theoretical and empirical work on the Industrial Revolution.","Voth, Hans-Joachim",10.1257/000282803321947083,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947083,2003/05,Living Standards During the Industrial Revolution: An Economist's Guide,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947083,2003.0,2631

5128,," This paper synthesizes findings from an ongoing research program on learning in signaling games. The present paper focuses on crossgame learning (the ability of subjects to take what has been learned in one game and generalize it to related games), an issue that has been ignored in most of the learning literature. We begin by laying out the basic experimental design and recapitulating early results characterizing the learning process. We then report results from an initial experiment in which we find a surprising degree of positive cross-game learning, contrary to the predictions of commonly employed learning models and to the findings of cognitive psychologists. We next explore two features of the environment that help to explain when and why this positive transfer occurs. First, we examine the effects of abstract versus meaningful context, an issue that has been largely ignored by economists out of the belief that behavior is largely dictated by the deep mathematical structure of a game. In contrast, results from cognitive psychology suggest that behavior may well be sensitive to context employed. Our results show that the use of meaningful context serves as a catalyst for positive transfer. Second, we explore how play by two-person teams differs from play by individuals. The psychology literature is quite pessimistic about the ability of teams to beat a ""truth wins"" standard based on performance of individuals. But teams easily surpass this norm in our cross-game experiment. We use the dialogues between team members to gain insight into how this transfer occurs, gaining direct confirmation for hypotheses generated by econometric analysis of earlier data.","Cooper, David J.

5131,," Noncooperative game theory combines strategic thinking, best-response, and mutual consistency of beliefs and choices (equilibrium). Hundreds of experiments show that in actual behavior these three forces are limited, even when subjects are highly motivated and analytically skilled (Camerer, 2003). The challenge is to create models that are as general, precise, and parsimonious as equilibrium, but which also use cognitive details to explain experimental evidence more accurately and to predict new regularities. This paper describes three exemplar models of behavior in one-shot games (thinking), learning over time, and how repeated ""partner"" matching affects behavior (teaching) (see Camerer et al., 2002b).","Camerer, Colin Ho, Teck Chong, Kuan",10.1257/000282803321947038,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321947038,2003/05,"Models of Thinking, Learning, and Teaching in Games",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321947038,2003.0,2636

5134,," Strong and widely accepted evidence shows that the natural rate of unemployment varies over time with substantial amplitude. The frictions in the labor market that account for positive normal levels of unemployment are not simple and mechanical. Instead, as a rich modern body of theory demonstrates, the natural rate of unemployment is an equilibrium in which the volumes of job-seeking by workers and worker-seeking by employers reach a balance controlled by fundamental determinants of the relative prices of the two activities. In recessions, unemployment rises, and job vacancies fall. The natural explanation is an economywide fall in labor demand. But a compelling model that generates a fall in labor demand without a counterfactual fall in productivity has eluded theorists to date. Nonetheless, policymakers have appropriately adopted the view that the natural rate varies over time and is not a simple benchmark for setting monetary instruments.","Hall, Robert E.",10.1257/000282803321946958,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321946958,2003/05,Modern Theory of Unemployment Fluctuations: Empirics and Policy Applications,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321946958,2003.0,2639

5136,," My first exposure to the psychological assumptions of economics was in a report that Bruno Frey wrote on that subject in the early 1970's. Its first or second sentence stated that the agent of economic theory is rational and selfish, and that his tastes do not change. I found this list quite startling, because I had been professionally trained as a psychologist not to believe a word of it. The gap between the assumptions of our disciplines appeared very large indeed. Has the gap been narrowed in the intervening 30 years? A search through some introductory textbooks in economics indicates that if there has been any change, it has not yet filtered down to that level: the same assumptions are still in place as the cornerstones of economic analysis. However, a behavioral approach to economics has emerged in which the assumptions are not held sacrosanct. In the following I comment selectively on the developments with regard to the three assumptions, on both sides of the disciplinary divide.","Kahneman, Daniel",10.1257/000282803321946985,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321946985,2003/05,A Psychological Perspective on Economics,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321946985,2003.0,2641

5138,," Inviting political scientists to tell economists how they could do better work is an act of disciplinary generosity. The reality is that contemporary political science is a net importer of ideas and methods from other disciplines, and from none more than economics. Indeed, some of the most exciting research in political science in the past 40 years has involved the incorporation of ideas from economics. We have neither the space nor the mandate to summarize that research here, but refer interested readers to Gary J. Miller's (1997) extensive review. Our aim here is to offertwo modest case studies of specific instances of overlap between the interests and research efforts of economists and political scientists. Our first case study focuses on describing and explaining participation in the workforce, the polity, and many other social activities and organizations. Our second case study focuses on the impact of political processes and institutions on macroeconomic policies and performance. In both these instances the work of economists has been quite fruitful—but also, we think, hampered by a characteristic overreliance on standard economic models and methods. However, in both areas, recent developments may point the way toward a more constructive research style combining the theoretical and empirical rigor of economics with a broader and more eclectic approach familiar to political scientists.","Bartels, Larry M.

We show that the expected pattern of AD duty recalculations over time crucially depends on the foreign firm's ex ante expectations of possible outcomes of AD policy enforcement. Our empirical analysis then confirms the role of ex ante expectations in explaining observed patterns of AD recalculations.

Krugman's (1980) model of monopolistic competition and transport costs. The commodity structure of production and bilateral trade is fully determined. Two main predictions emerge. Countries capture larger shares of world production and trade of commodities that more intensively use their abundant factors.

5240,," Standard incentive theory models provide a rich framework for studying informational problems but assume that contracts can be perfectly enforced. This paper studies the design of self-enforced relational contracts. I show that optimal contracts often can take a simple stationary form, but that self-enforcement restricts promised compensation and affects incentive provision. With hidden information, it may be optimal for an agent to supply the same inefficient effort regardless of cost conditions. With moral hazard, optimal contracts involve just two levels of compensation. This is true even if performance measures are subjective, in which case optimal contracts terminate following poor performance.","Levin, Jonathan",10.1257/000282803322157115,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803322157115,2003/06,Relational Incentive Contracts,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803322157115,2003.0,2745

The accepted belief is that givers treat the grants as imperfect substitutes for private giving. We theoretically and empirically investigate a second reason: the strategic response of a charity will be to reduce fund-raising efforts after receiving a grant. Employing panel data from arts and social service organizations, we find that government grants cause significant reductions in fund-raising. This adds a new dimension to the policy discussions - analysts should account for the behavioral responses of the charity, as well as the donors, to government grants.","Andreoni, James Payne, A.

Both in a North-North and North-South context, we show that, when globalization triggers an increased threat of technological leapfrogging or imitation, firms tend to respond to that threat by biasing the direction of their innovations towards skilled-labor-intensive technologies. We show that this process of defensive skill-biased innovations generates an increase in wage inequalities in both regions. We then discuss suggestive empirical evidence of the existence of defensive skill-biased technical change.","Thoenig, Mathias Verdier, Thierry",10.1257/000282803322157052,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803322157052,2003/06,A Theory of Defensive Skill-Biased Innovation and Globalization,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803322157052,2003.0,2751

We explore a game that convexifies the decisions, allowing us a better look at the indifference curves of bargainers while maintaining the subgame-perfect equilibrium. We conclude that bargainers' preferences are convex and regular but not always monotonic. Money-maximization is the sole concern for about half of the subjects, while the other half reveal a preference for fairness.

Results also reveal that industry-level data hide substantial intra-industry heterogeneity, violating the assumptions of the model and complicating the interpretation of results from earlier research.

Motivating effort may be difficult if the level of effort and quality of the resulting innovation are unverifiable, if innovators cannot benefit directly by marketing their innovations, and if the buyer cannot extract up-front payments from suppliers. We study the use of contests to procure an innovation in such an environment. An auction in which two suppliers are invited to innovate and then bid their prizes is optimal in a large class of contests.

We identify the key characteristics of rules that are robust to model uncertainty; such rules respond to the one-year-ahead inflation forecast and to the current output gap and incorporate a substantial degree of policy inertia. In contrast, rules with longer forecast horizons are less robust and are prone to generating indeterminacy. Finally, we identify a robust benchmark rule that performs very well in all five models over a wide range of policy preferences.","Levin, Andrew Wieland, Volker Williams, John C.",10.1257/000282803322157016,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803322157016,2003/06,The Performance of Forecast-Based Monetary Policy Rules Under Model Uncertainty,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803322157016,2003.0,2755
5251,, This paper presents a model of rational Bayesian agents with speculative attacks in a regime of exchange rate which is pegged within a band. Speculators learn from the observation of the exchange rate within the band whether their mass is sufficiently large for a successful attack.

We develop a model of asset ownership in trucking, which we test by examining how the adoption of different classes of on-board computers (OBCs) between 1987 and 1997 influenced whether shippers use their own trucks for hauls or contract with for-hire carriers. We find that OBCs' incentive-improving features pushed hauls toward private carriage, but their resource-allocation-improving features pushed them toward for-hire carriage.

However, when this distribution is unknown, a preset supply curve cannot maximize monopoly profits. The optimal pricing mechanism in this situation sets a price for each buyer on the basis of the demand distribution inferred statistically from other buyers' bids. The resulting profit converges to the optimal monopoly profit with known demand as the number of buyers goes to infinity, and convergence can be substantially faster than with sequential price experimentation.","Segal, Ilya",10.1257/000282803322156963,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803322156963,2003/06,Optimal Pricing Mechanisms with Unknown Demand,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803322156963,2003.0,2760

Most asset allocations are extreme (either 100 percent or zero percent in equities) and there is inertia in asset allocations. Equity allocations are higher for males, married investors, and for investors with higher earnings and more seniority on the job; equity allocations are lower for older investors. There is very limited portfolio reshuffling, in sharp contrast to discount brokerage accounts. Daily changes in equity allocations correlate only weakly with same-day equity returns and do not correlate with future equity returns.","Agnew, Julie Balduzzi, Pierluigi Sundén, Annika",10.1257/000282803321455223,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321455223,2003/03,Portfolio Choice and Trading in a Large 401(k) Plan,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455223,2003.0,2783

Allowing for the possibility of bounded strategic rationality and rational players' responses to it yields a sensible account of lying via costless, noiseless messages. In some leading cases, the model has generically unique pure-strategy sequential equilibria, in which rational players exploit boundedly rational players, but are not themselves fooled. In others, the model has generically essentially unique mixed-strategy sequential equilibria, in which rational players' strategies protect all players from exploitation.","Crawford, Vincent P.",10.1257/000282803321455197,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282803321455197,2003/03,Lying for Strategic Advantage: Rational and Boundedly Rational Misrepresentation of Intentions,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455197,2003.0,2786

A key result is that the future constituency for redistributive policies depends positively on current redistribution, since this affects both private investments and the future distribution of voters. The model features multiple equilibria. In some equilibria, positive redistribution persists forever. In other equilibria, even a majority of beneficiaries of redistribution vote strategically so as to induce the end of the welfare state next period.

In particular, we find that announcement surprises produce conditional mean jumps; hence high-frequency exchange-rate dynamics are linked to fundamentals. The details of the linkage are intriguing and include announcement timing and sign effects. The sign effect refers to the fact that the market reacts to news in an asymmetric fashion: bad news has greater impact than good news, which we relate to recent theoretical work on information processing and price discovery.","Andersen, Torben G.

Retail margins for specific goods fall during peak demand periods for that good, even if these periods do not coincide with aggregate demand peaks for the retailer. This is consistent with ""loss-leader"" models of retailer competition. Models stressing cyclical demand elasticities or cyclical firm conduct are less consistent with our findings.

We examine the impact of public information in a setting where agents take actions appropriate to the underlying fundamentals, but they also have a coordination motive arising from a strategic complementarity in their actions. When the agents have no socially valuable private information, greater provision of public information always increases welfare.

5305,," We use household data from northeast China to examine the link between investment and land tenure insecurity induced by China's system of village-level land reallocation. We quantify expropriation risk using a hazard analysis of individual plot tenures and incorporate the predicted ""hazards of expropriation"" into an empirical analysis of plot-level investment. Our focus is on organic fertilizer use, which has long-lasting benefits for soil quality. Although we find that higher expropriation risk significantly reduces application of organic fertilizer, a welfare analysis shows that guaranteeing land tenure in this part of China would yield only minimal efficiency gains.","Jacoby, Hanan G.

I use a new data set from archival sources of eighteenth-century China to revisit this question. This analysis suggests previous studies of market integration, which attribute much growth to a reduction in transport costs, have overestimated these effects. I find the overall level of market integration in China was higher than previously thought, and, intertemporal effects are important substitutes for trade.

5308,," This paper analyzes airport congestion when carriers are nonatomistic, showing how the results of the road-pricing literature are modified when the economic agents causing congestion have market power. The analysis shows that when an airport is dominated by a monopolist, congestion is fully internalized, yielding no role for congestion pricing under monopoly conditions. Under a Cournot oligopoly, however, carriers are shown to internalize only the congestion they impose on themselves. A toll that captures the uninternalized portion of congestion may then improve the allocation of traffic. The analysis is supported by some rudimentary empirical evidence.","Brueckner, Jan K.",10.1257/000282802762024548,American Economic Review,https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/000282802762024548,2002/12,Airport Congestion When Carriers Have Market Power,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282802762024548,2002.0,2813

Children from lowerincome households with chronic conditions have worse health than do those from higher-income households.

Uncertainty over the banks stems from certain assets, loans and trading assets in particular, the risks of which are hard to observe or easy to change. Banks' high leverage, which invites agency problems, compounds the uncertainty over their assets. These findings bear on both the existence and reform of bank regulation.

Consequently, these consumers rationally violate naïve formulations

5647,F12 F13," By considering a model with identical firms, Krugman (1980) predicts that a higher elasticity of substitution between goods magnifies the impact of trade barriers on trade flows. In this paper, I introduce firm heterogeneity in a simple model of international trade. I prove that the extensive margin and the intensive margin are affected by the elasticity of substitution in exact opposite directions. When the distribution of productivity across firms is Pareto, the predictions of the Krugman model with representative firms are overturned: the impact of trade barriers on trade flows is dampened by the elasticity of substitution, and not magnified.

5648,E24 E32 J31 J63 J64," Recently, a number of authors have argued that the standard search model cannot generate the observed business-cycle-frequency fluctuations in unemployment and job vacancies, given shocks of a plausible magnitude. We propose a new calibration strategy of the standard model that uses data on the cost of vacancy creation and cyclicality of wages to identify the two key parameters –- the value of nonmarket activity and the bargaining weights. Our calibration implies that the model is consistent with the data.

5649,F13 F14 L61," We develop a political economy model where loss aversion and reference dependence are important in shaping people’s preferences over trade policy. The policy implications of the augmented model differ in three ways: there is a region of compensating protection, where a decline in the world price leads to an offsetting increase in protection, such that a constant domestic price is maintained; protection following a single negative price shock will be persistent; and irrespective of the extent of lobbying, there will be a deviation from free trade that favors loss-making industries.  The augmented model explains protections of the US steel industry since 1980.

5650,J22 J23 J31 J64," When a job-seeker and an employer meet, find a prospective joint surplus, and bargain over the wage, conditions in the outside labor market, including especially unemployment, may have limited influence. The job-seeker's only credible threat during bargaining is to hold out for a better deal. The employer's threat is to delay bargaining. Consequently, the outcome of the bargain depends on the relative costs of delays to the parties, rather than on the payoffs that result from exiting negotiations. Modeling bargaining in this way makes wages less responsive to unemployment. A stochastic model of the labor market with credible bargaining and reasonable parameter values yields larger employment fluctuations than does the standard Mortensen-Pissarides model.

5651,I21 I28," Empirical and experimental evidence suggests different levels of sophistication among families in the Boston Public School student assignment plan. We analyze the preference revelation game induced by the Boston mechanism with sincere players who report their true preferences and sophisticated players who play a best response. We characterize the set of Nash equilibrium outcomes as the set of stable matchings of a modified economy, where sincere students lose priority to sophisticated students. Any sophisticated student weakly prefers her assignment under the Pareto-dominant Nash equilibrium of the Boston mechanism to her assignment under the recently adopted student-optimal stable mechanism.

5652,C78 D74," Building on previous work by Schelling and Crawford, we study a model of 
bilateral bargaining in which negotiators can make binding commitments at a low positive cost c. Most of our results concern outcomes that survive iterated strict dominance. If commitment attempts never fail, there are three such outcomes. In two of them, all the surplus goes to one player. In the third, there is a high probability of conflict. If commitment attempts succeed with probability q < 1, the unique outcome that survives iterated strict dominance entails conflict with probability q2. When c = 0, analogous results hold if the requirement of iterated strict dominance is replaced by iterated weak dominance.

the microeconomics of exporting. We build a heuristic model of transactions
between exporters and producers and relate it to East India Company (EIC)
operations in colonial Bengal. Our model and the historical record stress
two difficulties: the exporter and its agents might not uphold payment
agreements, and producers might not honor sales contracts. The model shows

analysis shows that the share of liquid assets that households invest in

demographic shifts affect profits and returns across industries. Cohort size fluctuations
produce forecastable demand changes for age-sensitive sectors, such as
toys, bicycles, beer, life insurance, and nursing homes. These demand changes are
predictable once a specific cohort is born. We use lagged consumption and demographic
data to forecast future consumption demand growth induced by changes
in age structure. We find that demand forecasts predict profitability by industry.
Moreover, forecast demand changes five to ten years in the future predict annual
industry stock returns. One additional percentage point of annualized demand
growth due to demographics predicts a 5 to 10 percentage point increase in annual
abnormal industry stock returns. However, forecasted demand changes over shorter
horizons do not predict stock returns. A trading strategy exploiting demographic
information earns an annualized risk-adjusted return of approximately 6 percent.

short-sighted and concentrate their innovation in booms, even when it is
optimal to concentrate it in recessions. Additional forces may imply that procyclical

When the monetary policy shock takes place in the first two quarters of the year, the
response of output is quick, sizable, and dies out at a relatively fast pace. In
contrast, output responds very little when the shock takes place in the third or fourth
quarter. We propose a potential explanation for the differential responses based on
uneven staggering of wage contracts across quarters. Using a dynamic general

5788,," The paper generalizes the Taylor principlethe proposition that central banks can
stabilize the macroeconomy by raising their interest rate instrument more than
one-for-one in response to higher inflationto an environment in which reaction
coefficients in the monetary policy rule change regime, evolving according to a
Markov process. We derive a long-run Taylor principle which delivers unique
bounded equilibria in two standard models. Policy can satisfy the Taylor principle
in the long run, even while deviating from it substantially for brief periods or
modestly for prolonged periods. Macroeconomic volatility can be higher in periods
when the Taylor principle is not satisfied, not because of indeterminacy, but because
monetary policy amplifies the impacts of fundamental shocks. Regime change alters
the qualitative and quantitative predictions of a conventional new Keynesian model,
yielding fresh interpretations of existing empirical work.

5789,," Using a Bayesian likelihood approach, we estimate a dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium model for the US economy using seven macroeconomic time series. The
model incorporates many types of real and nominal frictions and seven types of
structural shocks. We show that this model is able to compete with Bayesian Vector
Autoregression models in out-of-sample prediction. We investigate the relative
empirical importance of the various frictions. Finally, using the estimated model, we
address a number of key issues in business cycle analysis: What are the sources of
business cycle fluctuations? Can the model explain the cross correlation between
output and inflation? What are the effects of productivity on hours worked? What
are the sources of the ""Great Moderation""?

5790,," The positive correlation between real investment rates and real income levels across
countries is driven largely by differences in the price of investment relative to
output. The high relative price of investment in poor countries is due to the low price
of consumption goods in those countries. Investment prices are no higher in poor
countries. Thus, the low real investment rates in poor countries are not driven by
high tax or tariff rates on investment. Poor countries, instead, appear to be plagued
by low efficiency in producing investment goods and in producing consumer goods
to trade for them.

dilemma was substantially diminished when the payoffs were noisy, even though
players could monitor one anothers past actions perfectly. In contrast, in one-time

slowing the rate at which cooperation decays. These observations are consistent
with the robust observation from the psychology literature that partial reinforcement
(adding randomness to the link between an action and its consequences while

from three U.S. health clubs with information on both the contractual choice and the
day-to-day attendance decisions of 7,752 members over three years. The observed
consumer behavior is difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and beliefs.
First, members who choose a contract with a flat monthly fee of over $70 attend on
average 4.3 times per month. They pay a price per expected visit of more than $17,
even though they could pay $10 per visit using a 10-visit pass. On average, these
users forgo savings of $600 during their membership. Second, consumers who
choose a monthly contract are 17 percent more likely to stay enrolled beyond one
year than users committing for a year. This is surprising because monthly members
pay higher fees for the option to cancel each month. We also document cancellation
delays and attendance expectations, among other findings. Leading explanations for
our findings are overconfidence about future self-control or about future efficiency.
Overconfident agents overestimate attendance as well as the cancellation probability

persistent response of economic activity to the high-frequency fluctuations normally
associated with the cycle. We define as the medium-term cycle the sum of the highand

6654,E24 J23," This comment addresses a point raised in Russell Cooper and Jonathan Willis (2003, 2004), which discusses whether the ""gap approach"" is appropriate to describe the adjustment of production factors. They show that this approach to labor adjustment as applied in Ricardo J. Caballero, Eduardo Engel, and John C. Haltiwanger (1997) and Caballero and Engel (1993) can falsely generate evidence in favor of nonconvex adjustment costs, even if costs are quadratic. Simulating a dynamic model of firm-level employment decisions with quadratic adjustment costs and estimating a gap model from the simulated data, they identify two factors producing this spurious evidence: approximating dynamic adjustment targets by static ones, and estimating the static targets themselves. This comment reassesses whether the first factor indeed leads to spurious evidence in favor of fixed adjustment costs. We show that the numerical approximation of the productivity process is pivotal for Cooper and Willis's finding. With more precise approximations of the productivity process, it becomes rare to falsely reject the quadratic adjustment cost model due to the approximation of dynamic targets by static ones.

They claim that inefficient exclusion does not arise when buyers are homogenous firms that compete downstream. However, when upstream firms can compete in two-part tariffs, their equilibrium analysis contains some errors. Fixing these errors, inefficient exclusion arises when scale economies are sufficiently large or the entrant's cost advantage is not too big.
