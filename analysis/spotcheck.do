*Pretend you wanted to replicate your 20 assigned papers.
*First, is there any data or code, or is it just pure math/theory?
*If there's data/code, try and find it. (1)Visit the journal website and skim the article
*, google search for (1) the title and (2) the author, and (3) search dataverse
*If you find anything--OR NOT--compare what you find to the current answer in the dataset
*If there's anything that can be changed, edit it here:
*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQbD4w7j_HcUlGbMlFAyTt3x9AnfxxXUJTz8AKB9Mvs/edit?usp=sharing 

*pretend this is Stata code to modify specific observations
/*For example, say you actually found the data and code for one on dataverse, title "Prognosis Negative" doi:1776/1861.x */
