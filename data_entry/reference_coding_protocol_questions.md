# Questions


### Ravina
  1. Several articles have referred us to supporting information section on the AJPS website for code/dataset/statistical analysis. Sometimes a link or a .doc. How do we classify this? In the mean time, Terri and I have classified it as `supp_info`.

### Kevin

	1. What if the excerpt includes a reference to a URL but not the explicit URL? How would we code this? Row.283 racial predispositions. Models include control variables as discussed in text; complete results are AVAILABle from the author's web page.




### Terri
  1. There's an article that kept mentioning that additional analyses were available on the author's webpage, however there was no mention of the code or data being availble. I happened to check the journal and noticed that on the web page it says that all files can be found at that link. However, since it was written on the web page and not in the pdf, it did not show up in our file. (Journal Article #257 "What Stops the Torture").


### Rachel
  1.What if data reference is a cite of a paper? (not link/name)

  A: create a new option: paper.
