### What do I look for?
Find out the research field and type of data of an article. We want to investigate differences across fields and whether an article could have made data available.

### How do I classify an article into a research field?
There are five research fields

+ `political_theory`
+ `comparative_politics`
+ `international_relations`
+ `american_government_and_politics`
+ `political_methodology`

Use the classification from [What is Political Science?](https://www.polisci.washington.edu/what-political-science) to classify each article into one of above research fields using the `article_field` column.

You can start by looking at an article's abstract. If the abstract alone is not sufficient to classify the article, read through the article's introduction.

If you have trouble finding the correct research field for an article after above steps, leave `article_field` empty.

### How do I classify an article into a data type?
There are three data types

+ `no_data`: The article does not use any data (e.g. pure theory) or only simulated data (e.g. econometrics articles).
+ `experimental`: The article uses experimental data from laboratory or field experiments conducted by researchers (i.e. no natural experiments)
+ `observational`: The article uses observational data (e.g. from surveys, publically available datasets, own collection)

### Tip
`Ctrl/⌘ + Click` on the article title to open the article. You do not need to press `Ctrl/⌘`, if you uncheck `Ctrl-click required to follow hyperlinks`, which you can find in `LibreOffice` -> `Preferences` -> `Security` -> `Options`.
