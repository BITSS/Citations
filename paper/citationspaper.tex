\section{Introduction}

This is just a placeholder document so I can put all the figures and tables in one place. People [cite Vision, Piwowar] have found that data sharing is associated with more citations. This preliminary evidence shows that same relationship is present in political science, but seems to be due to confounders.

First, let's graph data availability over time in our two journals.

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../output/avail_time.png}
\pagebreak

What's the overall distribution of citations? Power law, big time.

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../output/cite_histo.png}

\pagebreak

Let's test whether we see the same positive association between data and citations as Vision, Piwowar. We do.

\input{../output/naive.tex}
\clearpage
\input{../output/naiveLN.tex}

Does the relationship hold if try to strip out the confounders? The first stage has a sufficiently strong F test, but the second stage shows a noisy effect. Results are significantly more positive if you restrict to the articles with data. (Columns 2, 4, 5)

Now the IV with LN

\scalebox{1.0}{
\input{../output/ivregLN.tex}
}
\pagebreak

Third, what things could be changing at the same time as the policy? Article topic, the type of data used, and the quality of the researcher could change. We have data on all three of these, and none look like they really change, though I haven't run statistical tests yet.

Maybe rankings of the top institutions of the authors changes a little?
