\section{Introduction}

This is just a placeholder document so I can put all the figures and tables in one place. People [cite Vision, Piwowar] have found that data sharing is associated with more citations. This preliminary evidence shows that same relationship is present in political science, but seems to be due to confounders.

First, let's graph data availability over time in our two journals.

Second, let's test whether we see the same positive association. We do.

\clearpage
\input{../output/naiveLN.tex}

Does the relationship hold if try to strip out the confounders? Preliminary evidence says no. The first stage has a sufficiently strong F test, but the second stage shows a noisy, possibly \textit{negative} effect.

\input{../output/ivreg.tex}

Third, what things could be changing at the same time as the policy? Article topic, the type of data used, and the quality of the researcher could change. We've got data on the first two, but still need to work with the data to get the university (and associated ranking) of the researchers.

It appears that the article topic and type really don't change before and after the policy.
