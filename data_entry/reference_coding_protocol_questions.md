	1.What if the excerpt includes a reference to a URL but not the explicit URL? How would we code this? Row.283 racial predispositions. Models include control variables as discussed in text; complete results are AVAILABle from the author's web page.**p < 0.01; *p < 0.05; ?p < 0.10, two-tailed. Schools SpendingThermome
	
	2. Row 336-340
	
	What if several records are made for the same excerpt?  Wouldn't coding these records skew the data when we make the analysis, perhaps in a statistically significant way? How would we remedy this problem? 
	
	
	3. Row 431 "also Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson 2002) for a discussion of these issues." 
	
	Would we code excerpts that cite other authors as "data_partial_name" or because these authors are not linked to a dataset, insitution, or website explicity, we would code them as NULL values. 
	
	4. Row 437. "y of incumbent politicians to run an electoral cycle in fiscal balance. Section three describes the DATA used in the empirical analysis. Section four presents the empirical specifications employed as well"
	
	How do we treat excerpts that make references to specific parts of the data, without referencing any of the valid entities needed to code it as "data".
	
	5. Row 650-656x
	How should we treat references to other authors in the Political Theory articles? Not many explicit mention of datasets, institutions, or websites, but many references to famous Political Theorists such as Rawls, Machiavelli,etc. 
	
	6. Row 1331. "els of Tables 2 and 3 nor the significance of the black representation variables (these results are AVAILABle upon request). However, the metropolitan a=rea dummies did alter the results in Table 4, so here t"
	
	How do we code self-referential excerpts?

  1. There's an article that kept mentioning that additional analyses were available on the author's webpage, however there was no mention of the code or data being availble. I happened to check the journal and noticed that on the web page it says that all files can be found at that link. However, since it was written on the web page and not in the pdf, it did not show up in our file. (Journal Article #257 "What Stops the Torture").
